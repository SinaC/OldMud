-1 'SPELL_GATE'~
Syntax: cast 'gate' <target>

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate, as well as in player who has no summon set.  Clan members 
may not be gated to except by their fellow Clan members.

-1 'SPELL_DETECT GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'detect good'
 
This spell enables the caster to detect good characters, which will
reveal a characteristic golden aura.
~

-1 'SPELL_DISPEL GOOD'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel good' <victim>
 
Dispel good brings forth evil energies that inflict horrific torment on 
the pure of heart.  Good-aligned characters use this dark magic at their
peril.
~


-1 'SPELL_RECHARGE'~
Syntax: cast 'recharge' <item>

The recharge spell is used to restore energy to depleted wands and staves.
Fully exhausted items cannot be recharged, and the difficulty of the spell
is proportional to the number of charges used.  Magic items can only be
recharged one time successfully.
~

-1 'SPELL_RAY OF TRUTH'~
Syntax: cast 'ray of truth' <target>

Ray of truth opens a portal to the planes of positive energy, bringing forth
a beam of light of sufficient purity to harm or or annihilate the servants
of evil.  It cannot harm the pure of heart, and will turn and strike 
casters who are tainted by evil.
~

-1 'SPELL_PORTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'portal' <target>

The portal spell is similar to gate, but creates a lasting one-way portal
to the target creature, instead of transporting the caster.  Portals are
entered using 'enter' or 'go' command, as in 'go portal'.  Portals cannot
be made to certain destinations, nor used to escape from gate-proof rooms.
Portal requires a special source of power to be used, unfortunately the
secret of this material component has been lost...
~

-1 'SPELL_NEXUS'~
Syntax: cast 'nexus' <target>

This spell is virtually identical to portal (see 'help portal'), with the
only difference being that while portal creates a one-way gate, a nexus 
spell makes a two-sided gate.  It also lasts longer than the lower-powered
portal spell.  Both spells require an additional power source, the secret
of which has been lost...
~

-1 'SPELL_HEAT METAL'~
Syntax: cast 'heat metal' <target>

Heat metal is a powerful magical attack spell, with effects that vary
according to the victim's armor.  It heats the target's metal equipment,
causing him or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the
process (possibly fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily).
This spell does no damage to creatures that are immune to fire.
~

-1 'SPELL_HOLY WORD'~
Syntax: cast 'holy word'

Holy word involves the invocation of the full power of a cleric's god, with
disasterous effects upon the enemies of the priest coupled with powerful
blessings on the priest's allies.  All creatures of like alignment in the
room are blessed and filled with righteous divine wrath, while those of
opposite morals (or both good and evil in the case of neutral priests)
are struck down by holy (or unholy might) and cursed.  The cleric suffers
greatly from the strain of this spell, being left unable to move and 
drained of vitality.  Experience loss is no longer associated with the spell.
~

-1 'SPELL_FRENZY'~
Syntax: cast 'frenzy' <target>

The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing
his or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine
wrath is coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety, 
making the character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm
spell (see 'help calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's 
alignment.
~

-1 'SPELL_CALM'~
Syntax: cast 'calm' 

One of the most useful and often overlooked abilities of the master cleric is
the calm spell, which can put an end to all violence in a room.  Calmed
creatures will not attack of their own volition, and are at a disadvantage
in combat as long as the spell soothes their minds.  The more violence 
activity there is in a room, the harder the spell, and it is all or nothing --
either all combat in the room is ended (with the exception of those who
are immune to magic) or none is.
~

-1 'SPELL_HASTE'~
Syntax: cast 'haste' <target>

The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing
an extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive
abilities in combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the system,
such that recuperative abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating
the slow spell. (see 'help slow').

At higher levels of casting (mage-types only), haste gives increased
bonuses to dexterity, has a longer duration, and allows even more extra
attacks.  It is rumored that at its highest level, haste prevents any
delay between casting of spells or use of skills during combat.  However,
the highest level of the spell may only be cast upon oneself.
~

-1 'SPELL_SLOW'~
Syntax: cast 'slow' <target>

Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with it's own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim,
it slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate
of attack.  The effect of slow also doubles movement costs and halves healing
rates, due to reduced metabolism.

At higher casting levels (mage-types only), slow decreases the victim's
chances of hitting on attacks beyond the first each round.  At its highest
casting level, slow greatly reduces that chance of any physical attacks
being made each round.
~

-1 'SPELL_PLAGUE'~
Syntax: cast 'plague' <target>

The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to
death.  It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like
wildfire if the victim makes it to a populated area.
~

-1 'SPELL_CREATE ROSE'~
Syntax: cast 'create rose'

A romantic spell that creates a fragrant red rose, with utterly no game
use whatsoever.
~

-1 'SPELL_PROTECTION GOOD'~
Syntax:	cast 'protection good' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~

-1 'SPELL_PROTECTION EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'protection evil' <target>

The protection spells reduce damage taken from attackers of the appropriate
ethos, and improve saving throws against all forms of magic. They may not
be cast on others, and one person cannot carry both defenses at the same
time.
~

-1 'SPELL_GIANT STRENGTH'~
Syntax: cast 'giant strength' <character>
 
This spell increases the strength of the target character.
~

-1 'SPELL_CHAIN LIGHTNING'~
Syntax : cast 'chain lightning' <target>

Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning
that arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully
expended.  Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell, while the caster
will not be struck unless no other viable target remains.  Chain lightning
is most effective when used on large groups of creatures.  At higher
casting levels, the bolts strike longer and for more damage.  At its
highest casting level, the caster is immune from being hurt by the bolts.
~

-1 'SPELL_MASS HEALING'~
Syntax: cast 'mass healing' 

The mass healing spell, as its name might suggest, performs a healing spell
on all players in the room.  It also throws in a refresh spell for good
measure.
~

-1 'SPELL_FLOATING DISC'~
Syntax: cast 'floating disc'

This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the casters level in minutes, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a maximum
of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location on the
character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it to run
out of energy.

At higher levels of casting, the floating disc has the power to confer upon
the caster increased wisdom, intelligence, and constitution.  It is even
rumored that at its most powerful strength, the floating disc can confer
upon its caster great stores of magical power.
~

-1 'SPELL_FIREPROOF'~
Syntax: cast 'fireproof' <object>

The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object,
to protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.  Items protected
by this spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell.
Although inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical
for protecting large numbers of objects.
~


-1 'SPELL_ARMOR'~
Syntax: cast armor <character>

This spell decreases (improves) the armor class of the target character.
The armor class improvement depends on the level of the caster.

At higher levels of casting, armor provides increased armor class
benefits and duration.  It also has a chance to fully absorb an opponent's
attack, though it can do so only once per spell level beyond 2.  Note
that the spell level will decrease by one every time an attack is
absorbed, though the armor class benefit will be unaffected by this change.
~

-1 'SPELL_BLESS'~
Syntax: cast bless <character>
Syntax: cast bless <object>

This spell improves the to-hit roll and saving throw versus spell of the
target character by 1 for every 8 levels of the caster. It may also be
cast on an object to temporarily bless it (blessed weapons, for example,
are more effective against demonic beings).

saving throw, has a chance to destroy the target's equipment with
acid and, at its highest level, will create multiple blasts of acid
from one casting.
~

-1 'SPELL_BURNING HANDS'~
Syntax: cast 'burning hands'  <victim>

This spell causes the caster to summon fire from his or her fingertips
to inflict damage on the victim.  At higher spell levels, this spell
causes more damage, negates the victim's saving throw, has a chance
to burn items carried by the victim, and causes the victim to become
more thirsty due to the intense heat.
~

-1 'SPELL_COLOUR SPRAY'~
Syntax: cast 'colour spray'   <victim>

This spell sends forth a spray of clashing colors that damages and has a
chance to blind your opponent.  At higher levels, the amount of damage is
increased, the chance of blinding your opponent is increased, and your
opponent loses his or her saving throw.  At its highest level, colour
spray is rumored to daze the victim and worsen his or her armor class
due to the coating of colorful paints.
~

-1 'SPELL_FIREBALL'~
Syntax: cast 'fireball'       <victim>

This spell summons forth a ball of fire which inflicts damage upon the
victim.  At higher spell levels, this spell negates its target's saving
throw, inflicts more damage, has the chance to burn the target's items,
and cause fire blindness.  At its highest spell level, multiple
fireballs will hit the target with each casting.
~

~

-1 'SPELL_MAGIC MISSILE'~

As your actual level increases, the number of missiles your conjure increases
as well.

At higher levels of casting, magic missile has added effects, such as
increased amounts of missiles, preventing your opponent from receiving a
saving throw for half damage, and increased damage per missile.  The highest
level version of this spell is rumored to do extreme amounts of damage per
missile.
~

-1 'SPELL_SHOCKING GRASP'~
Syntax: cast 'shocking grasp' <victim>

This spell causes electrical impulses to surge through the caster's hands
and inflict damage on the victim.  At higher levels, the amount of damage
inflicted increases, the victim loses their saving throw, the victim gets
hit with powerful shocks that can cause loss of equipment, and the victim
can even be shocked into unconsciousness.
~

-1 'SPELL_BLUR'~
Syntax: cast 'blur' <target>

The position of a mage with an active BLUR spell shifts and wavers. This
distorsion makes the character harder to hit with an attack.

be dispelled, notable examples are poison and plague.
~

-1 'SPELL_CANCELLATION'~

Cancellation can only be used on allies, but is much more effective and does
not provoke attack.  Unfortunately, the spells do not discriminate between
harmful and benign spells.

~

-1 'SPELL_ENCHANT WEAPON'~
Syntax: cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the weapon grows more
and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or destroyed by the
magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level of the weapon
by one.  At Spell Level 1, only damroll is affected.  At 2, both hit
and dam increase.  The amount of the increase per casting goes up with
each level after that.  At Spell Level 4 and above, only the caster will

makes the armor more effective by adding a magical benefit to the wearer's
armor class.  However, if cast upon an object too many times, enchant

properties, or possibly cause it to explode.  At higher casting levels,
enchant armor increases the magical benefits even more with each casting.
At its highest casting level, enchant armor adds a bonus to saving throws
instead of armor class.  At Spell Levels 4 and 5, the enchanted object
attaches itself to the caster and can thereafter only be worn by the

victim's regeneration rate. It may also be used to poison food, drink, or
a weapon in a fashion similar to envenom ('help envenom'), but with
drastically reduced effectiveness.  In addition, a poisoned character will
continue to take damage every minute for a set duration.  At higher spell
levels, the duration of the poison on an object or a character increases, as
does the reduction in the victim's strength and the amount of damage dealt
each successive round.  At its highest spell levels, poison also negates the
victim's saving throw and deals additional damage upon its casting.  At the
higher levels, when cast on weapons, poison affects them with the stronger
types of poison, from "type A" at Spell Level 1 to "type E" at Spell Level 5.
Note that at Spell Levels 4 and 5, poison will bind the weapon to the caster,

-1 'SPELL_SHARPEN'~
Much in the way a wizard can magicaly enhance a weapon a warrior can

fragile and could break. If you sharpen a blade too much it will break.

your message.

The race change is real, granting the caster any and all powers of the new race.
However, any special benefits of the caster's natural race are lost while this
spell is in effect.  In addition to most player races, several non-player races
are available with this spell.  A complete list of available races can be seen
by reading "help polymorph races."  This spell does have one catch.  When
it wears off or otherwise ends, there is a small chance that the caster will be
unable to return to his or her natural state, and instead be stuck in the new
form.  Note also that if a new form is of a different size than your original
race, only equipment you are wearing will resize itself to fit your new form.

~

-1 'SPELL_SPELLFIRE'~
Syntax: cast 'spellfire' <target>

The most powerful spell available to a general elementalist, spellfire taps
into the raw magic that flows through the elements.  The results are very
unpredictable, though often very devastating to the victim.  Spellfire
causes a random elemental spell from any of the four elemental schools to
be cast upon the victim.  Even if the caster does not know the spell, it
may end up being cast anyhow.  In addition, there is a chance that a non-
elemental spell will target the victim due to the raw magic that is being
tapped.  Spellfire has a chance to cast a beneficial spell on one's
opponent, or a harmful spell when cast upon oneself, though the opposite
affect is more likely (harmful spells on opponent and beneficial on
oneself).

-1 'SPELL_SUMMON ELEMENTAL'~
Syntax: cast 'summon elemental'

This powerful spell is used to summon an elemental creature to assist
the caster.  The strength of the being summoned is relative to the
strength of the caster.  The type of being summoned (fire, air, water, or
earth elemental) depends on the caster's specialty.  Non-elementalists
and general elementalists that study this spell should do so with caution,
as the elementals have been known to turn against such individuals.
~

An extremely powerful fire elementalist spell, fire rains down on anyone
and everyone near the caster.  The caster may get hit him or herself by

~

-1 'SPELL_RECKLESS DWEOMER'~
Syntax: cast 'reckless dweomer' <spell> <spell target>

The signature spell of Wild Magic users, reckless dweomer summons the raw,
wild magic of the world through the caster.  The caster then attempts to
craft the magic into the desired spell effect.  The actual chance of this
spell working is low, and decreases if the caster does not know the spell
that he or she is trying to simulate.  It decreases even further if the
caster is trying to cast a spell that is not normally castable by mages
of the caster's type.  If the caster does not successfully produce the
desired spell effect, he or she will Wild Surge.

It is important to remember to add the target or any other phrase normally
placed after the spell name when casting reckless dweomer, or else even
if the spell would have worked, it may still fail.
~

-1 'SPELL_ANIMAL FOLLOWER'~
Syntax: cast 'animal follower'

This spell allows a ranger to summon a natural creature to him or her.  This
creature will follow and assist the ranger, like a pet, though in truth the
bond is more that of a companion than a servant.
The casting level 2 is available only to the strongest rangers.  Much like
casting level 1, it allows the ranger to summon a companion.  However,
the companion summoned is far from a typical woodlands creature.  Instead,
this spell summons a mighty beast of almost legendary status to assist the
ranger.
~

Syntax: cast 'summon flesh golem'
Syntax: cast preserve <body part>

A Necromancer may create a flesh golem by gathering body parts and then forming
them into a flesh automaton. The power of the golem is dependent on the caster's
level and the number of parts. The 'preserve' spell is used to keep body parts
such as hearts, arms, legs and heads from decaying.
~

-1 'SPELL_SOULBIND' 'SPELL_MUMMIFY' 'SPELL_EMBALM' 'SPELL_DECAY CORPSE' 'SPELL_ANIMATE SKELETON' 'SPELL_ZOMBIFY'~
Syntax: cast 'mummify' <corpse>
Syntax: cast 'zombify' <corpse>
Syntax: cast 'soulbind' <follower>
Syntax: cast embalm <corpse>
Syntax: cast 'decay corpse' <corpse>
Syntax: cast 'animate skeleton' <skeleton>

These are the basis of a Necromancer's power. Decay corpse strips the flesh off
a corpse and leaves the skeletal remains. The skeleton may then be animated
using the 'animate skeleton' spell. Corpses that are still intact may be
animated with the more powerful zombify spell, or, at much higher levels,
raised as mummies with the mummify spell. 'Embalm' spell will preserve a corpse
and extend the duration before a it decays to dust. In all cases of animates
the undead raised will have a level of power comparable to it's living
existence but slightly lowered. Thus an orc zombie won't be as powerful as a
demon zombie. Skeletons are weaker than zombies, which are in turn weaker than
mummies. The number of undead you can raise is level dependent and also modified
by the type of undead you already have following you. Soulbind will bind an
undead follower to your soul and it will act as a loyal pet, entering and
leaving the realms with you like a normal pet.
See also: help 'animate object' for that version of animation.
