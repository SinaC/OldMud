-1 'MOUNT' 'DISMOUNT'~
Syntax: mount <creature>    or   use riding <creature>
Syntax: dismount

RIDING is a skill that enables a character to mount certain mobs and
ride them.  Not all mobs can be ridden.  Most often, mountable mobs are
pets; however, it is possible to mount non-pets as well.  When a mob that
is not a pet is mounted, the mob will become one's pet.  In order to ride
a mob, one must have a saddle, which is placed upon the mob's back when
mounting.  When mounted, a character does not expend any movement and is
able to enter rooms for which flying or swimming is required if the mount
can enter those rooms (regardless of whether the character can).
DISMOUNT will remove one from their mount, though the creature does
remain a pet.

-1 RESTRING STRENGTHEN~
Syntax: restring <bow>
Syntax: strengthen <bow>

A character skilled as a bowyer is a master of the craft of improving and
fixing bows.  Proficiency in this skill gives a character access to two
separate commands: RESTRING and STRENGTHEN.
RESTRING allows a character to repair frayed or broken bow strings.  A
character skilled as a bowyer is presumed to always have the materials and
tools necessary to replace the bow's string on him or her at all times.
Restring will not work on a bow with a level higher than the character's,
and may cause an already frayed bowstring to snap.
STRENGTHEN allows a character to improve his or her bow, thus causing it to
inflict more damage.  Strengthen can only be used on bows at least 2 levels
below the character's level.  Attempting to strengthen a higher level bow
could destroy it.  Strengthen will increase the bow's level in addition to
the damage it inflicts, and can only be used a limited amount of times
before a bow reaches its maximum strength.
