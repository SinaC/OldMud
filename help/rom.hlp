#HELPS

-1 LAG~
Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files
And the man pages, outdate
Beware the Internet my son,
The noise that hangs, the lag that kills
Beware the Usenet news, and shun the frivolous mud with frills
So took his his mudding client in hand
Longtime the virtual foe he sought
So rested he by the T1s three and paused a while in swap
And as in disk-drive swap he stayed,
The Internet, with lags of fame
Came packetwise through the T1 line
And error-checked as it came
One two one two and through and through, the mudding client went kill -9
He left it dead and with it's core he went a tracing back
And hath thou slain the Internet?
Come to my arms my disk-based bot!
Oh lag-free day, callooh callay, he chortled in his joy
Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files
And the man pages, outdate.

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.
It will be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and many
contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's
code from Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 102
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all clan members 
(including loners), provided the victim is is within 8 levels of the
character and is also in a clan.  This will flag you as a "killer" or
"thief", allowing any character to attack, and also provoking action
from the city guard.

[Now you could get the PK flag too without beeing in a clan. Go to the 
mayor's office and type PK (You've to be lvl 15 or above). When you're 
PK you could only kill other PK players (clan members and other PK 
flagged peoples). If you want to remove your PK flag ... ask an imm.
Not yet implemented.]
~

-1 RULES~
These are the rules of ROM.  For other matters, use common sense.

* Limited player stealing or player killing.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and
  you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent
  to the implementors.
 
* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health. If we catch
  you doing it, you will lose half your playing time.

{R* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.{x
 
* No kill stealing.  This means you cannot attack a mob someone else is
  fighting, unless they ask you to. Also avoid attacking fleeing mobs.

* No beating down a mob and fleeing so that players whom you cannot
  group with can then kill it and gain the experiece.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
  done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,
  and carry a black stick.

* Offensive behaviour, specifically verbal abuse of minorities,
  gay-bashing, sexism will result in deletion, or site ban. Sexual
  Harassment, or any form of harassment WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in any shape
  or form for any reason. You were warned.

* Naming your pet something inappropriate or stupid will not be tolerated.
  At the very least, an inappropriately named pet will be removed with no
  reimbursement.  Further punishment may be applied as deemed necessary or
  appropriate.  If the name wouldn't make a suitable name for a PC, then
  most likely it's also a poor choice for a pet name.

* Do NOT name pets after characters.  If you do, you will be denied or site
   banned.

* It is not permitted to advertise other muds over public channels, or notes.

* Do NOT share your password with anyone.  Sharing characters is against the
   rules and will result in the loss of any characters shared.

* Players do NOT have the right to demand restrings, name approvals, or anything
  else from an immortal.  Those that insist on pestering immortals will find the
  immortals less available when real help is needed.
~

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.

Type 'help petition' to see how to join a clan.

If you go Loner before level 25 you may join a Clan later.
   Joining a Clan is a dangerous step. Many adventurers live to 
kill and torture others and chances are that your paths will cross.
Remember, attacking or killing fellow clan members *IS* illegal except to 
mutiny your Clan leader.
   Existing Clans may buy special rooms and mobiles by acquiring 
gold as payment.  To see room prices, type "help upgrade".  
New Clans may be formed by petitioning the immortals. Please remember that 
their word is final on all matters not covered by this help.

it is higher.
~ 

0 MULTICLASS~
Syntax: multiclass <Class>

When you've reached level 100, you become HERO. But after a time ...
beeing hero starts to be boring. Now you could multiclass. When you 
multiclass, you've to choose a new class (another than your actual one).
You could multiclass many times you want (and available classes).
When you multiclass, your stats are kept (int, wis, dex ...)and your skills
and spells keep their rating but are only available at the required
level. You lose all your equipment but you get all newbie one.
You stay in your clan too at the same status.
Your XP/level is multiplied by number of classes you have.
So beeing multiclass [Mlt] is a really good value.
If you need more info about multiclassing ask an imm.

0 ALIGNMENT ETHO~
1) Lawful Good     - Lawful Good characters strive for those things that
                     will bring the greatest benefit to the most people
                     and cause the least harm.
2) Neutral Good    - Characters of this alignment believe that a balance of
                     forces is important, but that the concerns of law and
                     chaos do not moderate the need for good.
3) Chaotic Good    - Characters of this alignment are strong individualists
                     marked by a streak of kindness and benevolence.  They
                     believe in all the virtues of goodness and right, but
                     they have little use for laws and regulations.
4) Lawful Neutral  - Order and organization are of paramount importance to
                     characters of this alignmnet.  They believe in a strong,
                     well-ordered government, whether that government is a

                     of forces, and they refuse to see actions as either good
                     or evil.  Since the majority of people in the world make
                     judgments, true neutral characters are extremely rare.
6) Chaotic Neutral - Characters of this alignment believe there is not order
                     to anything, including their own actions.  With this as

7) Lawful Evil     - Characters of this alignment believe in using society
                     and it's laws to benefit themselves.  Structure and

                     provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and
                     servant.
8) Neutral Evil    - Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with
                     themselves and their own advancement.  They have no
                     particular objection to working with others or, for that
                     matter, going it on their own.
9) Chaotic Evil    - Chaotic evil characters are the bane of all that is good
                     and organized.  They are motivated by the desire for
                     personal gain and pleasure.  They see absoulutely nothing
                     wrong with taking whatever they want by whatever means
                     possible.
