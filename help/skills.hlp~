#HELPS

-1 'SKILL_RECALL' /~
Syntax: recall
        use recall

RECALL prays to your god for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to your recall point.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not 
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

-1 'SKILL_SCROLLS'~
Syntax: recite <target>
        use scrolls <target>

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it. Scroll is 
the reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
~

-1 'SKILL_STAVES'~
Syntax: brandish <target>
        use brandish <target>

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it. Staves is
the use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
~

-1 'SKILL_WANDS'~
Syntax: zap <target>
        use wands <target>

Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it. Wands is
the use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap') 
~

-1 EXOTIC WEAPONS WEAPON WEAPONSMASTER 'SKILL_AXE' 'SKILL_DAGGER' 'SKILL_FLAIL' 'SKILL_MACE' 'SKILL_POLEARM' 'SKILL_SPEAR' 'SKILL_SWORD' 'SKILL_WHIP' 'SKILL_STAFF(WEAPON)'~
Each weapon skill applies to a specific group of armaments, and determines how
well a character fights with a particular weapon.  The weaponsmaster group
provides talent in all weapons (save exotics), from chair legs to halberds.
If the character has the parry skill as well, he can parry incoming attacks.
The chance of parrying is best if the character in question is skilled at 
both his weapon and his opponent's.

The weapon skills consist of the following:

weaponsmaster	skill group of all weapons listed below (save exotic weaponry)
axe		the use of axes, ranging from hand to great (but not halberds)
dagger		the use of knives and daggers, and other stabbing weapons
flail		skill in ball-and-chain type weapons
mace		this skill includes clubs and hammers as well as maces
polearm		the use of pole weapons (except spears), including halberds
spear		this skill covers both spears and staves, but not polearms
sword		the warrior's standby, from rapier to claymore
whip		the use of whips, chains, and bullwhips
staff(weapon)	this skill covers staff but not spears.
exotic		the use of strange magical weapons

The exotic skill cannot be purchased, and is dependent solely upon level.
~

-1 'SKILL_SHIELD BLOCK'~
Shield block is a rather fancy name for the art of parrying with a shield.
Characters with no shield block skill will not be able to defend themselves
well with a shield.  All classes may learn shield block, but only warriors and
clerics are good at it.  Beware, flails ignore shield blocking attempts, and
whips have an easier time getting around them.  Axes may split shields in two.
~

-1 'SKILL_BERSERK'~
Syntax: use berserk <target>

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 'SKILL_DIRT KICKING'~
Syntax: use 'dirt kicking' <target>

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever 
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.
~

-1 'SKILL_DODGE'~
In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 'SKILL_ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 'SKILL_ENVENOM'~
Syntax: use envenom <target>

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison 
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates 
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.
~

-1 'SKILL_KICK'~
Syntax: use kick <target>

Kicking allows the adventurer to receive an extra attack in combat, a powerful
kick. However, a failed kick may throw an unwary fighter off balance.
~

-1 'SKILL_PARRY'~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting 
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

-1 'SKILL_RESCUE'~
Syntax: use rescue <target>

A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with
the rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede
in combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully the
favor will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as
well as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target. (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster)
~

-1 'SKILL_TRIP'~
Syntax: use trip <target>

Back by popular demand.  Trip is a somewhat dastardly attack, and involves
using any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea, and agile ones will
find the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
~

-1 'SKILL_SECOND ATTACK'~
Training in second attack allows the character a chance at additional strikes
in combat -- allow a 100% second attack does NOT guarantee 2 attacks every
round.  Any class may learn this skill, although clerics and mages have a 
very hard time with it.
~

-1 'SKILL_THIRD ATTACK'~
Training in third through seventh attacks allows the character a chance
at an additional strike in a combat, and increases the chance of all
previous attacks as well.  Perfect skill in an attack does NOT assure that
many attacks per round.  The amount of attacks a player may learn is
dependant on his or her class.
~
-1 'SKILL_FOURTH ATTACK'~
Training in third through seventh attacks allows the character a chance
at an additional strike in a combat, and increases the chance of all
previous attacks as well.  Perfect skill in an attack does NOT assure that
many attacks per round.  The amount of attacks a player may learn is
dependant on his or her class.
~
-1 'SKILL_FIFTH ATTACK'~
Training in third through seventh attacks allows the character a chance
at an additional strike in a combat, and increases the chance of all
previous attacks as well.  Perfect skill in an attack does NOT assure that
many attacks per round.  The amount of attacks a player may learn is
dependant on his or her class.
~
-1 'SKILL_SIXTH ATTACK'~
Training in third through seventh attacks allows the character a chance
at an additional strike in a combat, and increases the chance of all
previous attacks as well.  Perfect skill in an attack does NOT assure that
many attacks per round.  The amount of attacks a player may learn is
dependant on his or her class.
~
-1 'SKILL_SEVENTH ATTACK'~
Training in third through seventh attacks allows the character a chance
at an additional strike in a combat, and increases the chance of all
previous attacks as well.  Perfect skill in an attack does NOT assure that
many attacks per round.  The amount of attacks a player may learn is
dependant on his or her class.
~

-1 'SKILL_FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.  Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is 
possible for it to fail.  All class may learn this skill, but mages find it
very difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
~

-1 'SKILL_HAGGLE'~
Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are 
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best 
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling, 
although other classes may learn it as well.
See 'help config' for more information about autohaggle.
~

-1 'SKILL_PEEK'~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~

-1 'SKILL_PICK LOCK'~
Syntax: use 'pick lock' <target>

Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by  
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 'SKILL_MEDITATION'~
This skill is similar to fast healing, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase mana recovery when the character is sleeping or resting.
Thieves and warriors, with their troubled minds and violent attitudes, have
much trouble learning to meditate.
Meditation level 2 is an advanced form of the meditation skill.  Characters
skilled in meditation 2 will recover mana at an even faster rate than those
only skilled in meditation. Meditation works automatically.  It does not 
require any command word.
~

-1 'SKILL_STEAL'~
Syntax: use steal coins <character>
        use steal <object> <character>

Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise 
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~ 

-1 'SKILL_CAMPFIRE'~
Syntax: use campfire

The fire skill enables you to build a small campfire that will help
you recover more quickly. It will cost you 100 moves to collect
wood, pile it up, and light the fire. You can only start fires in
woods, hills or mountains.
~

-1 'SKILL_HUNT'~
Syntax: use hunt <target>

With this skill you can track down a mob. It will tell you which direction
to go to find it. However if you are not very skilled it will give you
the wrong direction occasionally.
~

-1 SKILL_COMMON SKILL_ELFISH SKILL_DWARFISH SKILL_GNOMISH SKILL_GIANTISH SKILL_GOBLINISH SKILL_FAERISH SKILL_DRAGONISH SKILL_UNDERDISH SKILL_LIZARDISH~

Racial language are automatically used when talking through (via) channels:
 say, yell, dirsay, whisper, ic    which are RP channels

See also help about language.
~

-1 'SKILL_MISTFORM'~
Syntax: use mistform

One of the powers of the vampire, it turns a vampire into a bilious
green mist, able to slip through the smallest of cracks and affording
resistance to the burning touch of the sun's rays.  It also improves
one's armor rating.  However, vampires find it quite impossible to do
damage in combat while in mistform.
To deactivate mistform, simply type use mistform a second time. 
~

-1 'SKILL_FLIGHT'~
Syntax: use flight

One of the powers of the vampire, it allows to vampire to fly.
To desactivate flight, simply type use flight a second time.
~

-1 'SKILL_SPEEDUP'~
Syntax: use speedup

Give the quicklings the possibility to move very quickly, giving them
extra attacks but a lower heal/mana/move/psp rate.
To desactivate speedup, simply type use speedup a second time.
~

-1 'SKILL_INVISIBLE'~
Syntax: use invisible

Give the sprites the possibility to become invisible.
To desactivate invisible, simply type use invisible a second time.
~

-1 'SKILL_RESIZE'~
Syntax: use resize <object> <size>

RESIZE allows a character to use their skills of armor or jewelry
smithing to change the size on an item of armor or a piece of jewelry.
This skill is well known by dwarves, though a few other races possess
this talent as well.
~

-1 'SKILL_CIRCLE'~
Syntax : use circle <victim> 

Circle is a deadly and powerful form of attack most commonly used by 
those of little or no honor, such as thieves and assassins.  It 
involves circling around one's opponent in combat and stabbing them 
with a critical hit.  Circle combined with multiple attacks per round, 
can be a very deadly and powerful skill.  Circling is most effective 
when done with a dagger. 
~

-1 'SKILL_TAILSWEEP'~
Syntax: use tailsweep <opponent>

TAILSWEEP is a combat skill possessed by certain races with large tails
that can be easily used in combat.  Tail sweep knocks the opponent off
of their feet, causing large amounts of damage and dazing them for a few
moments.  
~

-1 'SKILL_DUAL WIELD' SECOND~
Syntax : second <weapon>

Dual wield is a skill that allow a player to wield
a weapon in their off-hand. The extra weapon must each weigh less than
the weapon that is held in the primary hand.
Dual wield 2 is an attack skill unique to the ranger class.  It allows
the ranger a chance at an additional strike with an offhand weapon in combat
-- although a 100% dual wield 2 does NOT guarantee two attacks with the
offhand weapon every round.
~

-1 'SKILL_BLEND'~
Blend is a skill that allows one to blend into natural terrains.  It is not
effective in indoor, city, or water filled areas.  Like sneak, blend will
stay on when one moves.  However, as long as one does not engage in combat,
stop blending, or move into a non-natural terrain, blend will remain in
effect.  Like sneak and hide, those that can detect hidden can detect
blended individuals.
~

-1 'SKILL_FADE' FADING~
Fade is the natural ability to phase out of reality to an extent that
weapons will pass right through your form harmlessly.  A potent defensive
skill, it works naturally, not requiring any command word.
~

-1 'SKILL_FEED'~
Syntax: use feed <target>

Feed is a vampire only skill.  The process of feeding is
a quick bite at a vital area during combat.  As the victem
becomes more readily aware of its demise the chance
to feed declines until the victem is too aware of its
mortality and the feeding attempt is unavailable.

A certain amount of health can be reclaimed by
the consumption of blood in a successful feeding
attempt.
~

-1 'SKILL_WHIRLWIND'~
Syntax: use whirlwind

Whirlwind requires the use of the skill dual wield.
Warriors (and others) using whirlwind attack all mobs
and pk players within a room with one or both of thier
two weapons as they spin about like dervish.
~

-1 'SKILL_SOOTHE'~
Syntax: use soothe <target>

SOOTHE is a skill used to calm a wild animal.  It will only work on targets
that qualify as being animals.  Soothed animals will not attack of their
own volition and are at a disadvantage in combat for a time after having
been soothed.  Soothe can only be used during combat, and the more combat
in the room at the time the skill is used, the more difficult it is to
use it.
~

-1 'SKILL_SCRIBE'~
Syntax: use scribe <spell> <parchment>

The scribe skill allows mages to create scrolls of spells that they know.
These scrolls can then be recited or sold to other mages that are seeking to
study the spell.  In order to scribe a spell, the mage must purchase a blank
piece of parchment from a magic shop.  These parchments are normally quite
costly.  In addition to the requirement of making a successful scribe skill
check, the scriber must also make a successful skill check with the spell he
or she is scribing.  Failure to make either skill check will destroy the
parchment, and could result in a magical explosion.
~

-1 'SKILL_STUDY'~
Syntax: use study <spellname> <# of trains>

This powerful skill allows a mage to attempt to learn a spell that is not in
his or her school of spells.  To use the skill, the mage must first obtain a
scroll containing the spell he or she wishes to study.  The mage must then
choose the number of trains he or she wishes to dedicate to studying the
spell.  Up to 10 trains may be so chosen.  To successfully learn the spell,
the mage must pass two random checks.  The first one is the mage's skill in
study, and if it fails, the scroll will be destroyed.  The second check is
the chance that the mage actually learns the spell.  For each train
dedicated to this skill, there is a 5% chance to learn the spell.  The
maximum chance is 50%.  If this second check is unsuccessful, the scroll
will be destroyed, and all trains dedicated to the task WILL BE LOST.  If
the check is successful, the trains and scroll will be lost as well, but the
spell will be learned.

Note that a spell may not be studied until its Level 1 prerequisites are
first learned.  Further note that a mage may not increase their spell level
in any spell that is learned through study.
~

-1 'SKILL_IMPROVED EXOTIC'~
Improved exotic (or improved exotic weaponry) increases a character's
skill with exotic weapons.  While skill in exotic weapons in normally based
solely on character level, purchasing and practicing this skill increases a
character's skill in exotic weapons beyond that which is normal.  In
addition, characters with this skill tend to do an increased amount of
damage when using exotic weapons.
~

-1 'SKILL_SNEAK'~
Syntax: use sneak

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Typing hide or sneak
a second time will cancel them.  Hide has the added benefit of increasing
the chance of a backstab hitting your opponent.
~

-1 'SKILL_HIDE'~
Syntax: use hide

Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Typing hide or sneak
a second time will cancel them.  Hide has the added benefit of increasing
the chance of a backstab hitting your opponent.
~

-1 'SKILL_BLEND'~
Syntax: use blend

Blend is a skill that allows one to blend into natural terrains.  It is not
effective in indoor, city, or water filled areas.  Like sneak, blend will
stay on when one moves.  However, as long as one does not engage in combat,
stop blending, or move into a non-natural terrain, blend will remain in
effect.  Like sneak and hide, those that can detect hidden can detect
blended individuals.
~

-1 'SKILL_DUAL DISARM'~
Syntax: use 'dual disarm' <opponent>

Dual disarm allows a character an even greater chance to disarm their foe in
combat.  It works exactly the same way as the disarm skill; however, it is
only effective if the character is wielding a second weapon in his or her
offhand.  The increased chance of effectiveness occurs only when the
character is also wielding a weapon in his or her primary hand and is
skilled in both disarm and dual disarm.  A character can be skilled in dual
disarm without being skilled in disarm, in which event disarm attempts can
only be made with the offhand weapon or without any weapon.

See also, 'help disarm'.
~

-1 'SKILL_DISARM'~
Syntax: use disarm <target>

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon.

For information on the dual disarm skill, see 'help dual disarm'.
~

-1 'SKILL_DUAL PARRY'~
Dual parry is the ability to parry and attack with an offhand weapon (see
'help dual wield').  A weapon must be wielded in the offhand in order for
dual parry to be effective.  The chance for success is less than that with
parry, and is affected by the difference in level between the two
combatants.
~

-1 'SKILL_RIDING' 'MOUNT' 'DISMOUNT'~
Syntax: mount <creature>    or   use riding <creature>
Syntax: dismount

RIDING is a skill that enables a character to mount certain mobs and
ride them.  Not all mobs can be ridden.  Most often, mountable mobs are
pets; however, it is possible to mount non-pets as well.  When a mob that
is not a pet is mounted, the mob will become one's pet.  In order to ride
a mob, one must have a saddle, which is placed upon the mob's back when
mounting.  When mounted, a character does not expend any movement and is
able to enter rooms for which flying or swimming is required if the mount
can enter those rooms (regardless of whether the character can).
DISMOUNT will remove one from their mount, though the creature does
remain a pet.

RIDING 2 is an advanced form of the riding skill.  A character skilled in
riding 2 has an increased chance to successfully mount and dismount 
creatures, including those that are not the character's current pet.
Of course, it is physically impossible to even attempt to mount some
creatures.

In addition to the above, RIDING 2 also confers the ability to ride without
the need for a saddle.  This requires a skill check and the character will
be unable to mount if the check fails.
~

-1 'SKILL_APPRAISAL'~
Syntax: use appraisal <item>

The appraisal skill allows a character to evaluate the worth of an object.
Any object the character is carrying can be appraised.  The appraised value
is based solely on the estimated value that the object can be sold for in a
shop, and does not factor in magical enhancements or rarity.  If the
character's appraisal skill check fails, the character will incorrectly
appraise the item's value.  Note that shopkeepers may not necessarily pay an
object's true appraised value when purchasing it, and may sell objects for
more or less than their appraised value.
~

-1 'SKILL_BACKSTAB'~
Syntax: use backstab <victim>

Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It
can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing
weapons such as daggers.  The damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by
the attacker's level, his weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of
his opponent.  You must be not visible to the mob (i.e. sneaking or hiding)
in order to backstab.
~

-1 'SKILL_POISON DETECT'~
Syntax: use 'poison detect' <object>

This skill allows the user to detect poison in or on an item.
~

-1 'SKILL_PURIFY'~
Syntax: use purify <object>

Purify is essentially the opposite of the envenom skill (see 'help
envenom').  It is used to remove poison from food and drink.  In addition,
it will remove poison from a weapon.  If successful, purify will remove all
poison from a weapon, whether placed there by use of magic, envenom, or
otherwise.  The removal of the poison is permanent.
~

-1 'SKILL_ALIGN DETECT'~
Syntax: use 'align detect' <target>

This skill will allow the user to determine the general alignment of
the target character.
~

-1 'SKILL_MAGIC DETECT'~
Syntax: use 'detect magic' <object>

This skill allows the user to determine whether an item has
magical properties.
~

-1 'SKILL_GOUGE'~
Syntax: use gouge <victim>

Gouge is a rather dishonorable combat tactic.  Those characters skilled in
gouging can attempt to gouge their opponent's eyes during combat.  If
successful, the gouge attack inflicts damage and has a chance to temporarily
blind the victim.
~

-1 'SKILL_COUNTERFEIT'~
Syntax: use counterfeit <object>

COUNTERFEIT allows a character to change the appearance of an object making
it appear to be more valuable than it actually is.  In addition, counterfeit
allows a character to attempt to pass off this increased value to a
shopkeeper.  Most shopkeepers are astute at looking for counterfeit goods;
therefore, characters unskilled in counterfeit that attempt to sell
counterfeit goods to a shopkeeper are often caught.

The counterfeit skill will increase the apparent value of an object up to
three times its original value.  An object can only be counterfeited once.
Objects without any value cannot have their value increased.

A character that is caught attempting to sell counterfeit goods will
generally be banned from a shop in the same manner that a character
insulting a shopkeeper with a haggle offer will (see 'help haggle').  Note
that selling counterfeit goods requires a skill check when the goods are
sold as well as when the counterfeiting is done, so even a learned
counterfeiter may on occasion be caught.
~

-1 'SKILL_SIGNAL'~
Syntax: use signal <message>

Signal is a special form of communication used to convey messages to other
of the same class as the character.  Signal is only available to thieves and
ninjas.  It will convey a message to others that are in the same room as the
signaler.  Both the signaler and any target characters must make successful
signal checks in order to receive the message.  Signal works even if the two
characters do not speak the same languages, as the message is conveyed by
hand signals and gestures instead of spoken words.  Note that the signaling
method used by thieves and ninjas differs; therefore, although both classes
have access to the skill, they cannot receive or relay signals to one
another.
~

-1 'SKILL_DISGUISE'~
Syntax: use disguise <good/neutral/evil>
Syntax: use disguise <lawful/neutral2/chaotic>
Syntax: use disguise <race>
Syntax: use disguise none

DISGUISE is a skill by which a character can hide their true race and/or
alignment from others.  One can disguise their good/evil alignment as well
as their lawful/chaotic alignment.  Note that neutral2 is used for
neutral as to law/chaos.  Disguise none will cancel all disguises.

When disguising one's race, one may only change into a race that players
are allowed to choose, including races only available through remort.
However, undead (rebirth) races are only available as a disguise for other
undead, and Ancients are never available as a disguise.  In addition, one
may only disguise themselves as a race of equivalent size to their own.

Disguise is useful in fooling creatures into believing you are someone
that you are not.

Disguising oneself takes a lot of energy, and therefore uses half of
one's movement per attempt.
~

-1 'SKILL_DETECT EXITS'~
Syntax: use 'detect exits'

This skill will show you all exits from a room.  In addition to showing
visible exits, if successful, this skill will inform you of the location
of any hidden or concealed exits.
~

-1 'SKILL_EVASION'~
Much like the dodge skill (see 'help dodge'), evasion allows a character
to "evade" an attack, avoiding all harm.  When combined with the dodge
skill, evasion can make a character very difficult to hit.
~

-1 'SKILL_IMPROVED STEAL'~
Improved steal increases a character's chance to successfully steal an
object from another character.  A character must be skilled in both steal
and improved steal to enjoy this benefit.

See also, 'help steal'.
~

-1 'SKILL_COMPREHEND LANGUAGES'~
The comprehend languages skill allows a character to have a chance to
understand any language spoken, even if he or she does not speak that
language.  This skill does not confer the ability to speak the language.  In
addition, it does not make up for poor skill in a language by the speaker.

Comprehend languages also allows the character to read icnotes written in
any language.  It does not, however, allow a character to write icnotes in
languages that he or she had not studied.

Comprehend languages works automatically, without the need to type anything
in to activate it.
~

-1 'SKILL_ASSASSINATION'~
Assassination is a very powerful and very deadly skill.  It is available
only to the highest level thieves, and most of those that train in the skill
do so in secrecy.  Characters trained in the art of assassination are extra
deadly when using the backstab and circle fighting techniques.  Once skilled
in assassination, the character's chance to hit with a backstab or circle
attack increases slightly, and the character has an improved chance to make
backstab attacks against those that can see him or her.  The most deadly
part of the skill, however, is the ability to strike one's opponent multiple
times at once.  A thief skilled in assassination gets a chance for his or
her full amount of attacks, including attacks with dual wielded weapons,
plus one extra attack beyond those whenever backstabbing or circling an
opponent.  Assassination works automatically, and does not require any key
phrase to be entered to trigger it.
~

-1  'SKILL_SPECIALIZATION' SPECIALIZE~
Syntax: specialize <weapon-type>
	use specialization <weapon-type>

Weapon specialization allows a character to choose one weapon type
which he or she concentrates most of his or her fighting skill in.
When purchasing the skill, type in specialize <weapon-type> to choose
the type of weapon you desire to be specialized in.  You may only be
specialized in one weapon type ever, so choose carefully.  You may also
only specialize in weapons which you are already fully proficient in
(in other words, your skill is at 100% already).

Once specialized, you chance to hit and your damage done with your
chosen weapon type is increased.  Also, your chance of getting extra
attacks in combat with that weapon type is increased.

For information on specialization in schools of magic, see 'help magic
specialization'.
~

-1 'SKILL_ARMSLORE'~
Syntax: use armslore <object>

Armslore is similar to lore, but only reveals general information about
weapons and armor.  It does not reveal any magical enchantments upon the
item.
~

-1 'SKILL_LORE'~
Syntax: use lore <object>

Lore is a general skill, consisting of knowledge of myths and legends. Use
of the lore skill gives a chance of obtaining information on an object,
concerning its power and uses.
~

-1 'SKILL_BASH'~
Syntax: use bash <target>
Syntax: use bash <object or door> (Bash 2 and 3 only)

Bash is a brute-force attack designed to knock your foe to his or her
knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the bash rating, your
weight, and the size of your opponent.  Bashing a dragon is not generally a
wise idea.  Bashing has a small percentage chance to knock an item off of
your opponent.

Bash 2 does not have a special command line.  Simply type bash followed by
the name of the object or door that you wish to bash, and an attempt will be
made.

Bash 3 does not have any special command.  Once it is purchased, it will
take effect immediately upon use of the bash command.  The chance of
successfully hitting with a mighty bash 3 depend on a character's skill in
bash, bash 2, and bash 3, as well as some random luck.
~

-1 'SKILL_CLEAVE'~
Syntax: use cleave <victim>
        use cleave

CLEAVE is a skill unique to barbarians.  It involves a mighty heft of your
weapon, and causes considerable damage to your opponent.  However,
cleave does take a lot of energy, leaving one unable to perform other
acts for a moment or two.  Also, it can not be done with all weapon types
and is more effective when done with a two-handed weapon.  Cleave has a
chance of destroying your opponent's shield, if your opponent has one.
~

-1 'SKILL_HEADBUTT'~
Syntax: use headbutt <target>

Headbutt is a powerful skill unique to the barbarian class.  Headbutt, when
successful, causes damage to your opponent and has a chance to knock him or
her unconscious.  The greater your size is over that of your opponent, the
more damage your headbutt will do.  Headbutt should be used with caution,
however.  If the headbutt misses, or is attempted on a target that is larger
than you, you will find yourself lying on the ground, often without your
weapon in your hand anymore.
~

-1 'SKILL_SHIELD BASH'~
Syntax: use 'shield bash' <target>

Shieldbash, like bash, is an attack designed to knock a character's opponent
off of his or her feet.  Unlike bash, shieldbash requires the character to
be wearing a shield at the time of the attack.  The character thrusts
forward with his or her shield, using it to injure his or her opponent and
possibly knock items out of their hands.  The effectiveness of the bash is
determined by many factors, including the size of both combatants.
~

-1 'SKILL_MOUNTED COMBAT'~
Mounted combat gives the character extra bonuses while engaged in combat
while riding a mount.  Specifically, both the character and the mount's
armor class rating receive bonuses during combat.  In addition, the
character has an increased chance to strike his or her target while engaged
in mounted combat.  Note that neither the armor class nor hitroll bonuses
will appear in a character's score or affects, but they are added in during
battles.
~

-1 'SKILL_CHARGE'~
Syntax: use charge <victim>

Charge is a powerful combat skilled that can only be learned by paladins and
blackguards.  In order to charge, a character must be riding a mount and
learned in the mounted combat skill (see 'help mounted combat').  Charge can
only be used to initiate combat, and is a difficult attack.  If successful,
however, a charge attack will cause great amounts of damage to an opponent.
A charge attack is most devastating when performed with a spear or a
polearm.  Charges cannot be performed without a weapon or with a dagger
or an exotic weapon.
~

-1 'SKILL_BOND'~
Syntax: use bond

BOND allows a paladin or blackguard to create a special bond with his or her
mount.  A bond can only be initiated while mounted (see 'help riding'),
though it will continue even after the character has dismounted.  The bond
has great benefits to both the character and the bonded mount.  Both receive
increases to all of their statistics, a benefit to their saves, and an
increase in their hit points, mana points, and movement points dependent on
the level of the other member of the bonded partnership.  In addition,
bonded mounts have the ability to quickly locate their partner character if
they should become separated.  A failed attempt at a bond, however, has a
draining affect on the character, leaving him or her without any mana or
movement points.

Despite all of the bonuses of the bond, there is one major drawback.  If the
bonded mount should happen to die, the affects on the paladin or blackguard
are devastating.  They are instantly drained of all mana points and all
movement points, and left with only one hit point.  This is due to the utter
shock to the character's system over the loss of the bonded union with the
mount.
~

-1 'SKILL_COUNTER'~
Counter is an extremely powerful weapon skills.  It allows one to reverse
their opponent's attacks onto their opponent.  The opponent is then actually
hit by his or her own attack.  Counter works automatically, there is no need
to type anything in to activate it.
~

-1 'SKILL_FAVORED ENEMY'~
Syntax: use 'favored enemy' <race>

One of the trademark skills of the ranger, the favored enemy skill allows a
character to select one race against which he or she is particularly
proficient.  Once the skill is gained, typing 'use 'favored enemy' <race>' at 
one's guildmaster will select the character's favored enemy race.  Once chosen, 
a favored enemy race cannot be changed.  A ranger cannot select his or her own
race as the ranger's favored enemy.

When a ranger encounters his or her favored enemy in combat, the ranger has
an increased chance to hit, does greater amounts of damage, and has a chance
to strike the enemy with an extra attack each combat round.
~

-1 'SKILL_ARCHERY' FIRE~
Syntax: use archery <victim> [direction]
     or fire <victim> [direction]

ARCHERY is a skill that gives the character proficiency in the use of bows
and arrows.  In order to use this skill, one must be wielding a bow and have
arrows either in his or her inventory or in a quiver.  Archery allows a
character to fire upon a target that is one room away in any direction
(assuming that it is a normal two-way exit).  Simply typing fire <victim>
will fire an arrow at the victim.  If there are multiple victims with the
same name in different directions, fire <victim> [direction] (i.e.
 fire dog north) can be used.  Firing an arrow at a creature is a 
hostile act and generally will cause the target to come searching for the 
shooter.  Wielding a bow while engaged in melee combat is also a bad idea, 
as it is basically useless in such a situation. Firing an arrow at a target 
may cause the arrow to become lodged somewhere on his or her body.  
See 'help dislodge' for more information.
A character skilled in higher archery level has a chance to shoot a number
of arrows equal to archery level in each firing attempt instead of just one.
However, even 100% skill in higher archer level does NOT guarantee two shots 
per firing attempt.
Archery code based on Bowfire Code v1.0 (c)1997-99 Feudal Realms.  Revised
for LOD2 by Julian - June, 2003.  Revised for Mystery by SinaC - July, 2003.
~

-1 'SKILL_FLETCHER'~
Syntax: use fletch arrow

A character skilled as a FLETCHER has the ability to make arrows.  A
fletcher will always have or be able to quickly find the raw materials
necessary to make an arrow: a stick of wood, a piece of flint, some twine,
and a feather or leaf.  Due to the common nature of these items, fletchers
are presumed to always have them in their possession.

~

-1 'SKILL_DISARMING SHOT'~
Syntax: use 'disarming shot' <victim> [direction]

DISARMING SHOT is a specialized shot used by an archer to attempt to disarm
his or her target.  A disarming shot will not inflict any damage on the
target, as it is intended solely to dislodge the target's weapon from his or
her hand.  Firing a disarming shot is considered a hostile act and may
result in the target coming after the shooter.  Only one disarming shot may
be fired at a time, and it cannot be fired over long range or at point blank
range.

~

-1 'SKILL_BOWYER' RESTRING STRENGTHEN~
Syntax: restring <bow>
Syntax: strengthen <bow>

A character skilled as a bowyer is a master of the craft of improving and
fixing bows.  Proficiency in this skill gives a character access to two
separate commands: RESTRING and STRENGTHEN.
RESTRING allows a character to repair frayed or broken bow strings.  A
character skilled as a bowyer is presumed to always have the materials and
tools necessary to replace the bow's string on him or her at all times.
Restring will not work on a bow with a level higher than the character's,
and may cause an already frayed bowstring to snap.
STRENGTHEN allows a character to improve his or her bow, thus causing it to
inflict more damage.  Strengthen can only be used on bows at least 2 levels
below the character's level.  Attempting to strengthen a higher level bow
could destroy it.  Strengthen will increase the bow's level in addition to
the damage it inflicts, and can only be used a limited amount of times
before a bow reaches its maximum strength.
See also: help archery
~

-1 'SKILL_STRENGTH SHOT'~
A character skilled in strength shot has the ability to add his or her
strength and its associated damage roll to the damage done by shot arrows.
Without this skill, damage roll is not added to the damage caused by arrows
that are fired.  However, this skill allows a character to increase the
tension applied to the bowstring, thus adding the strength-based damage roll
in when the arrow makes contact with its target.
~

-1 'SKILL_IGNITE ARROW'~
Syntax: use ignite <arrow>

Characters with skill in IGNITE ARROW are able to light arrows on fire, thus
making them inflict flaming damage on their target in addition to the
arrow's regular damage.  Attempting to ignite an arrow that is too powerful
for a character may result in the arrow being destroyed by the flames.
An arrow will only remain lit of fire for a short time.  Once that time,
which does increase with a character's level, has expired, the flames will
consume the arrow and it will be destroyed.

~

-1 'SKILL_LONG RANGE SHOT'~
A character skilled in LONG RANGE SHOT can fire arrows to distances
greater than normal.  Specifically, a character with this skill can fire at
targets that are up to three rooms away, provided that the rooms are in a
straight line.  In order to shoot long distances, the player MUST include
the direction that he or she wishes to fire after the name of the target.
Only one long range shot can be taken at a time due to the concentration
needed to fire over the distance.  Thus, second, third, or fourth shots will
not fire when shooting long range.  In addition, the further away the target
is from the archer, the less of a chance that the shot will hit.
Example of how to fire long range:
In order to fire at a guard that is directly south by three rooms, type
'fire guard south'.  Note that if one were to only type 
'fire guard', a guard that is more than one room away would not be
 targeted.

~

-1 'SKILL_SHARPEN ARROW'~
Syntax: use 'sharpen arrow' <arrow>

Sharpen arrow is a skill used to improve the condition of an arrow.  It adds
the "sharp" flag to the arrow, causing it to do more damage.  The arrow will
remain sharp only for a limited duration, which increases with your level.
Trying to use this skill on an arrow too powerful for you could result in
its destruction.
~

-1 'SKILL_POINT BLANK SHOT'~
A character skilled in POINT BLANK SHOT can fire an arrow at a target
that is in the same room as the character.  A point blank shot has a greater
chance to hit the victim than a normal shot.  Depending on how successful
the shot is, it may do a lot more more damage than a normal shot.  Due to
the closeness of the victim, only one point blank shot can be taken at a
time.  Thus, second, third, or fourth shots will not fire when shooting
point blank.
Point blank shots cannot be used while engaged in melee combat.  Further,
firing at a victim point blank tends to enrage the target and cause them to
attempt to kill the shooter.
~

-1 'SKILL_CRITICAL SHOT'~
Critical shot is the ability of an archer to aim his or her arrows
directly for the most vital spots on an opponent.  This is an extremely
difficult skill to master, but once an archer becomes learned in it, his or
her arrows can strike for devastating amounts of damage.  Skill in critical
shot increases the damage dealt on all shots, including those fired at point
blank range or over long range.
See also: help archery
~


-1 'SKILL_STUN'~
Syntax: use stun <victim>

Stun is an extra attack that can be used during combat to both inflict
damage upon one's opponent as well as to knock the opponent to the ground.
It can only be used by character's that are fighting without any weapon,
shield, held item, or armor (though non-armor equipment and clothing may be
worn).
~

-1 'SKILL_FLEETFOOTED'~
Characters adept at this skill have the ability to pass over any form of
terrain with minimal usage of movement points.  Regardless of what form of
terrain the character is passing through, those that make successful
fleetfooted skill checks will consume no more than one movement point per
step.  Fleetfooted works automatically and does not require any keyword to
activate.
~

-1 'SKILL_TUMBLE'~
Tumble is a favored skill of the nimble monk class.  Monks who are
unencumbered with armor or weapons may be able to swiftly tumble and avoid
an opponent's attack.  As opposed to simply dropping prone on the ground to
avoid one attack (and welcome a more devastating attack to one's backside),
a character that tumbles will quickly drop and roll, only to find him or
herself standing erect and ready to continue battling.  Tumble will not work
if the character is wearing armor (though wearing non-armor equipment is
fine), holding a weapon, holding a shield, or holding an item in his or her
hand.
~

-1 'SKILL_HAND TO HAND'~
Learning hand to hand combat skill gives a character a weapon even when
disarmed -- their bare hands.  Trained hand to hand experts are far more
effective than many swordsmen.  Monks are best known for their use of hand
to hand combat skill, though any class may learn it.

Hand to hand 2, 3, 4 and 5 is an advanced form of hand to hand combat.  
It allows the character (normally a monk) to receive an additional strike 
each combat round, and increases the amount of damage each of his or her 
hand to hand strikes inflicts.  In order for hand to hand 2 to be effective, 
the character cannot be wielding a weapon, cannot be using a shield, cannot 
be holding anything in his or her hand, and cannot be wearing any armor 
(though other non-armor clothing pieces are fine).
~

-1 'SKILL_BLOCK'~
Much like dodge and tumble, block is a skill used by the monk to help
compensate for the character's inability to fight effectively while wearing
armor.  A block attack utilizes the monk's powerful arms and legs to knock
an incoming attack aside, thus avoiding any serious damage.  Block will not
work if the character is wearing armor (though wearing non-armor equipment
is fine), holding a weapon, holding a shield, or holding an item in his or
her hand.
~

-1 'SKILL_PURE BODY'~
A character with the pure body skill gains the natural ability to prevent
diseases from affecting him or her.  Whenever the character would otherwise
contract a disease, the pure body skill is automatically checked, and if
successful, the disease is prevented.  Pure body is also effective against
spells that drain one's strength, such as weaken, energy, and deplete
strength.  Pure body will not prevent lycanthropy.
~

-1 'SKILL_DEFLECT'~
Deflect is a powerful defensive skill that allows a character to use his
or her bare hands to knock an incoming strike away.  Unlike block, which
utilizes one's arms and legs, deflect involves simply reaching a hand out
and pushing the incoming attack to one side or the other, thus avoiding any
damage.  As with many of the monk's skills, deflect will not work if the
character is wearing armor (though wearing non-armor equipment is fine),
holding a weapon, holding a shield, or holding an item in his or her hand.
~

-1 'SKILL_DIAMOND BODY'~
A character with the diamond body skill gains the natural ability to
prevent poisons from entering his or her bloodstream and causing damage or
even death.  Whenever a character would otherwise be envenomed by a poison,
the diamond body skill is automatically checked, and if successful, the
poison is prevented.  Diamond body is more effective against lower-grade
poisons, but does have a chance to work on even the most powerful of
poisons.  Diamond body is also effective in downgrading the effect of
certain ice/cold based spells such as chill touch.
~

-1 'SKILL_HANDS OF MULTITUDE'~
This skill's only use is when combined with two or more of the monk
"hands" skills (hands of energy, hands of fire, hands of ice, hands of acid,
and hands of draining).  It allows a monk to overcome the normal restriction
of only having one of these skills active at a time.  There is no special
keyword needed to activate this skill.  Rather, it simply works when a monk
with one "hands" skill already active attempts to add a second.  There is no
limit on the amount of "hands" skills that can be activated at one time,
though each successive skill has a shorter duration and is more difficult to
add.  If a second (or further) skill is not successfully added, all active
"hands" skills are immediately canceled.
~

-1 'SKILL_ROUNDHOUSE KICK'~
Syntax: use roundhouse <victim>

Roundhouse kick is a kick attack that inflicts greater damage upon one's
opponent than a standard kick (see 'help kick').  As with a normal kick,
roundhouse is an extra combat attack that requires a keyword to use.  Unlike
normal kicks, however, roundhouse takes longer to recover from.  In
addition, characters may not attempt a roundhouse unless they are fighting
without any weapon, shield, held item, or armor (though non-armor equipment
and clothing may be worn).  It is not necessary to know the kick skill in
order to learn roundhouse kick.
~

-1 'SKILL_FADE'~
Fade is the ability of the monk to draw upon his or her ki forces to
briefly phase out of reality.  This skill allows weapons and attacks that
would have otherwise made contact and dealt damage to simply pass right
through the character leaving him or her unharmed.  Unlike other monk
skills, fade will work regardless of what the monk may be carrying or
wearing.  Fade works automatically and does not require a command word.
~

-1 'SKILL_FLURRY OF FISTS'~
Much like the advanced hand to hand combat techniques (hand to hand 2, 3,
4, and 5), flurry of fists is an advanced form of hand to hand combat
employed by monks.  Flurry of fists allows the character to strike his or
her opponent an additional time each combat round.  It also increases the
amount of damage that each successful unarmed strike does.  In order for
flurry of fists to be effective, the character cannot be wielding a weapon,
cannot be using a shield, cannot be holding anything in his or her hand, and
cannot be wearing any armor (though other non-armor clothing pieces are
fine).
In addition, a character striking with flurry of fists has a chance to speed
his or her attacks up so fast that the character receives a full set of
additional attacks in the round.  In other words, the character's total
amount of strikes could double, or even more as the new set of strikes carry
with them yet another chance for a lightning fast flurry.  This power makes
flurry of fists the most powerful skill available to the monk.
~


-1 'SKILL_THIRD WIELD' 'SKILL_FOURTH WIELD' THIRD FOURTH~
Syntax: third  <weapon>
Syntax: fourth <weapon>

Third wield, and Fourth are skills that allow a player to wield
a weapon in their third or fourth hands as well if their
race has them. The extra weapons must each weigh less the the weapon
that is held in the primary hand.
~

-1 'SKILL_CLIMBING' climb~
Syntax: climb <direction>
        use climbing <direction>

This command is used to attempt to climb in the desired direction.  Certain
exits require skill in climbing or a rope in a character's inventory to pass.
Flying characters can often pass through these exits without climbing as well.
If a character is able to pass through a climb exit, his or her pet will go 
along as well, being assisted by the character.  Other characters or creatures
cannot be assisted, however. Success in climbing is not guaranteed, and the 
climbing character does risk falling down and being injured.
~

-1 'SKILL_SHAPECHANGE'~
Syntax: use shapechange wolfs
Syntax: use shapechange bear
Syntax: use shapechange <race>
Syntax: use shapechange none

The ability to shapechange into various forms is one of the most unique
skills available to the druid.  There are three levels of this skill.
By purchasing any one of the three levels, the druid gains the ability to
shapechange into a wolf.  Upon purchase of two levels of this skill, the
druid can choose between wolf form and bear form.  Upon purchase of all
three levels, the druid can shapechange into any race listed in 'help
shapechange races'.  In addition, upon purchase of all three levels of
this skill, the druid's shapechange no longer has a duration.  Instead, it
will last until canceled via the 'shapechange none' command or upon
death.

'use shapechange none' will revert the druid to his or her natural form.
~

-1 'SKILL_CONCENTRATION'~
This skill is similar to meditation, but relies on the concentration and
mantras to increase psi points recovery when the character is sleeping or
resting. Meditation works automatically.  It does not require any command
word.
~

-1 'SKILL_REPAIR'~
Syntax: use repair <object>

This skill allows to repair worn items such as armors and weapons.  It
doesn't require any components or special material.
~

-1 'SKILL_FORGE'~
Syntax: use forge <weapon>

This skill is used to weighten mace-like weapons, after that they have a
chance to do more damage.
~

-1 'SKILL_VORPALIZE'~
Syntax: use vorpalize <weapon>

This skill transforms any sharped weapon in a deadly weapon.
~

-1 'SKILL_REARKICK'~
Syntax: use rearkick [<victim>]

This skill, unique to centaur, allows them give a kick with their rear legs.
~

-1 'SKILL_FREEFLEE'~
Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, freeflee gives the clever combatant
a chance to flee his opponent without losing any experience points.
~

-1 'SKILL_SHARPEN'~
Syntax: use sharpen <weapon>

This skill is used to make better sharpeness of daggers and sword. They then
do more damage.
~

-1 'SKILL_BREW'~
Syntax: brew <component> [<component>] [<component>] [<component>]

Brew is used to create potions.  In order to create a potion, one must first
collect potion components.  Potion components are objects that can be brewed
into a potion.  Between one and four potion components may be used to brew
a potion.  Potion brewing can be dangerous, however.  Some components are
unstable and cause explosions when brewed.  Also, a single potion cannot
contain more than four spells.  If a variety of components is used that
results in a potion with more than four spells, the entire mix will explode,
injuring the brewer.  Note that not every spell possible from each component
will necessarily make it into the potion.  Note further that multiple
components that produce the same spell increase your chance of getting that
spell into your potion.  Enchanters are innately better at this skill than
most other classes.
