in all its personifications: love between parent and child, love between

friends, love for king and country, and, of course, romantic love.


Aislara herself can often be unpredictable and mercurial in temperament, as

she embodies the full mixture of emotions that go along with love.  It is

believed that for every soul there is another that is a perfect match for

them, and Aislara is often called upon to bless the unions of those who have

sandstorms, tornados, hurricanes, lightning storms, blizzards, and more.

Alesm'hai herself is not overly bloodthirsty.  Her nature is more an example

of barely contained duality: creation and destruction, peace and power.  She

is perceived differently by different people.  Sea-faring people regard her

with a mixture of awe, fear and respect, for she is the bringer of treasure

and the destroyer of villages.  Desert dwellers fear her sandstorms but

welcome her rains.  Arctic dwellers fear her blinding blizzards.


Alesm'hai's chosen form is that of an elven female, with alabaster skin,

raven-black hair, chiseled features, and silver eyes.  She favors diaphanous

gowns that ripple and flow like the clouds that surround her realm.  Her

symbol is a silver lightning bolt on a black disc.

barefoot with a deep royal blue cloak and hood.  She wears a blue topaz

pendant on a silver chain and a silver armband in the shape of a serpent

by the Dark Lord.  This point had baffled the sages for centuries until a

solution was offered: As a creature of shadows and darkness, Dulac favors

stealth and deception over strength and brute force.


Dulac himself has never been known to act without a purpose, his every

action part of a greater design.  He is a manipulator, pulling strings from

the shadow until his enemies have brought about their own destruction, a

process he refers to as \"The Art of the Unseen Hand\".  Indeed, he has been

neutral, the affairs of realms beyond his own kingdom rarely interesting

him.  The views mortals hold of him vary widely from culture to culture.

Some view him as a vengeful, wrathful god, a destroyer to whom sacrifices

are required to stay his storms.  Others see him as an essentially gentle

god, the provider of calm seas, good winds, and bountiful catches.


Sea-elven culture in particular reveres Tirluas, seeing him as a gentle

provider who delights in the rich diversity of his realm.  Through his

storms, Tirluas punishes the unrighteous and protects the sea-elves from

the uncivilized heathens of the surface.  The truth is that Tirluas has

times shone favor upon the sea-elves, his most treasured of children.

However, Tirluas is basically a neutral god of nature, viewing destruction

and creation as merely part of the natural world.


Tirluas's true form is that of an enormous silvery green sea-serpent, whose

breath and thrashing tail are the wind and waves of the ocean storm.

However, he often adopts the form of a sea-elf.

God 'Yuri Longshadow' {
  Title = 'Goddess of Mischief';
  Story = "The Goddess of Mischief, Yuri Longshadow is the author of many acts of

destruction, but can hardly be called an ally of evil.  What damage she

causes is largely due to her reckless nature, lack of respect, desire to

keep things \"interesting\", and her general inability to hold things sacred.

However, she is not an ally of good either, as she is far too untrustworthy

and irresponsible to be relied upon.  She will rarely help others unless

there is something in it for her.  She is a trickster and a liar whose sole

purpose seems to be causing outrage and frustration in others.  Yuri prefers

her followers to take no allegiance to any institution or government.


Yuri Longshadow is also the Goddess of Luck, shining good fortune upon those

who please her.  However, in this too does she cause mischief, as she is as

fond of leaving someone in the lurch as she is of granting good fortune.


Yuri Longshadow's symbol is an onyx disc, edged with a ring of silver and

containing a stylized pair of silver dice.  Yuri herself is a notorious

shapeshifter, taking many forms.  However, when she wishes to be recognized,

she takes the form of a young human female with blue eyes and a long dark

braid, garbed in the clothes of Sea Isles thieves and gamblers.  She is

often accompanied by a large black raven.
