Mud was down because server disk crashed

 

For this reason, player files have been lost.

Players stats/level cannot be restored, except for

1) Immortals. They will be put back on their former level on simple demand.

I have no way to check if it is the right person, so idle imms will be deleted.

 

2) Clans members

 

Former clan member will be advanced level 10

Former clan leaders will be advanced level 25

 

3) Good players can be given trivia points. Yes : I DECIDE WHO.
