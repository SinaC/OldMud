I have an idea on donated items.  I think is's okay to not be able to sell

donated items, but I do think you shold be able to re-donate them back to

the pit.  It will make it easier to get rid of, an in a friendly, lets-

An enemy meter would be cool to have.

Something like this Enemy: [{r++{Y+++{G++++{x]

It helps out and breaks up the damage spams a bit.

Text
I noticed that the flame blades, and likely the ice knives will dissolve in 

battle with no warning, and cannot be recast until the battle's over.  I

suggest giving a bit of warning (a flickering or something - like torches) or 

have the spells castable in combat.

 

My 2 cents worth,

One idea I really liked on a mud I work on is an area_construction flag.

This helps in many ways, as you can prevent teleport/gating to unfinished areas

use of eq or killing mobs from unfinished areas, or more personally, not

have the questmaster send you to unlinked areas.

Text
I was on at the time the idea about flagging unfinished areas on the area list

was suggested by the player.  I personally, as a builder, think it's a good one.

 

I feel it adds to the anticipation of its arrival, yet lets everyone know that

the mobs from there are off-limits.  I caught a player summoning mobs out of

mine before it was done, and I didn't like that very much.

 

Just my two cents worth :)

Text
Ok...I know I'm just a mortal here at the moment but...

It seems like you people are kinda short-handed 

on the builder side of things not to mention the player side.

Anyway my idea...how about cleaning up the area list so that 

when you look at it, it is in order of levels (i.e. starting at 

1st level and advancing up through the suggested levels)

Believe me when I tell you that this makes things more convenient

by a long shot. Also, it seems to me that

there are *lots* of empty help files. If someone is needed to write

these I can volunteer. Roland knows that I have been an Imm on other

muds at times. So I'll voluteer at bit of time. Like someone noted

the other day, this is too good of a mud that you have going here 

to have this small of a player base. So I suggest advertising word of mouth.

Tell everyone you know. Maybe haSender  Zap~

On another mud, I saw a skill called divert.

It's the opposite of rescue, it redirects a

mob toward another member of the group, instead

of rescuing. It was a nice skill for role

playing thieves, you didnt get rescue, but

you could divert.

Subject Cleric/Mage/Monk Spell Suggestion...~
Text
So many muds have enhanced str, weaken, in one form

or another. I was on another mud a while back that

had spells like cast 'dragon wit' or 'dwarven vigor'

which enhanced wisdom or constitution. In fact for

every attribute,there was an enhancement spell.

 

It allows senior characters to help newer players,

it also provides an alternate to stat eq as the

sole method of improving stats for fighting or

leveling. I suggest that each magic class be

able to improve by spell it's primary stat, and

maybe one other related stat. So a class which

is say wisdom based, would maybe be able to

enhance wisdom (by spell on others, something 

like +2) and one other stat (int, con, dex) whatever

makes sense for the class (or race).

 

You could, if concerned, limit to only one (or two)

of these spells being on a player at any given

time. Though personally I think it'd encourage

some additional interaction between players if

there weren't any limits.

Text
Hi,

My client can trigger and run a vb or java script based

on what it sees coming in from the mud. This works pretty

well, I am able to reliably have my triggers know my hp,

mana, movement, and other things. I'd like to suggest a

new prompt option, status, to show sleeping, resting,

standing, fighting, meditating and any other possible

status. This would let my client easily determine say if

i was within 25 percent of full health to send a roundhouse

each round, and if under 25 percent to say beam me outa

combat. Of course if not in combat I don't want these

things done, thus as part of the prompt, knowing what the

status of the character is would be helpful. Also being able

to know the name of the assailant would be helpful. Thus

statistics could be kept about how I performed when

engaging various characters:-)

 

Thanks:-)
