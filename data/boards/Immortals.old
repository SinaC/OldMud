I don't know if gylian has gotten to you before this does, but

I told him I'd speak to you, and said I couldn't promise results.  

Anyhow, he says that if he doesn't get restored that he will leave.

He points out that he spent almost 200 hours here, and that it was

expensive.  Also, since we are trying to reconstruct our player base

I don't think it would be good to lose him.

I know that brings up the, well if we do him we have to do everyone

problem.  I believe that everyone should be done.  I trust the players

here.  Perhaps we should only restore them to a fraction of their old

level

And of course we would only restore levels, and nothing else.

Anyhow, I have said my piece about that.  Take it as you will.

Subject Mud Connector~
Text
This will probably anger you (if your not angry from the other note).

In an attempt to bring in more players (since we've lost at least 1/2)

I assigned Kay to put this mud back on the new mud listing on mud

connector.  I am aware that only implementors are supposed to 

do things like that, and kay only did it under my instruction.

My thoughts was that, since we just had a pwipe and serval crashes, we

lost many of our players.  This means we need to advertise our mud

to get new players.

We are on mud connectors big list, this is true.  However the following

is true: 1) We are way down on that list.  2) Nobody looks at the 

big list straight through.  3) On a search for mystery we are the fifth

entry.  4) On a search for all Rom muds we are near the bottom.

5) Most people find what they are looking for in 3 or 4 entries.

6) Most people check out the New Listings first.

So being on the new listings as A mystery mud greatly increases our

chases of getting new players, over our current listing.

I have kay righting the description, because he's the most enthusiastic

player we have, and I don't really have the time (and am not sure what

to say ;} ).

Oxtal,

   I have been reading your mobprogram references and examples.

   I learn best when i try things along the way, and so I have tried to put

    together a little mobprogram.  Please keep in mind that I have not

   done any programming in 6-7 years. I would appreciate any feedback

   on it as you get the time.

 

   class ShardQuest

   {

       OnGreet()

       {

          >examine $k

          if (ch.carry(s) == "shard"

          {

             >say Ah, you have found it!

             >bow

          }

          else

          {

             >say Have you found it?

             >frown

         }

       }

       OnGive()

       {

          if (obj == "shard")

          {

             >say Thank you

             >bow

          }

          else

          {

             >say That's not it

             >give (obj) act

          }

       }

     }

 

Again, I hope I am learning a little of the code...if not, please be patient 

   I will work hard to correct my mistakes.   :)

Oxtal,

 

  Just dropping a quick note to throw some ideas for new things

 on Mystery.  I was thinking about a few new races...maybe a 

 feline-type race (different than Nekojin), a Wolfen-type race, a 

 minotaur race, or a lion-type race. I just think a few new interesting 

 races might really get Mystery moving fast.  I was also thinking 

 about a magic missile type spell that would include multiple missiles.  

 I saw ROM code for this on the WWW.  I also saw ROM code for 

 a type of Resurrect spell.  Again, I think new things on Mystery might

 spark a big interest in new players.  I have seen many muds over

 the years use new and interesting additions to get a playerbase 

 growing.  I enjoy Mystery very much and am just trying to throw

 things at you that you might like and find useful. I am certainly not

 trying to tell you what to do, as you are very good at your job.

 If you get the time...please drop me a note in reply.

 Also, if you are worried about the coding for some of these 

 additions, I have seen them on the WWW.

 

 Thanks,

I will make this quick.  All of the new area's (the ones made

specifically for this mud) give terrible xp as compared to other

levels.

When I say this you must understand that I believe that they should

have a more difficult time as there level increase.  However, I

watched as Gylian fought something that was 15 levels above him

almost die, and (he had >10% of his hp left, he started full and)

with all spells) only get 21 xp from it.

Every player above level 60 complains that all of a sudden it

became impossible to find experience, and I feel that something

needs to be done to fix it.  If one of you could go through and 

make a (hopefully) quick adjustment to the way xp is figured,

even if it's just the way it's figured above level 50 (The general

cut off point) then it will make alot of people happy.  End the

complaints to me, and probably convince more people to continue.

Which by the way maybe (but isn't yet) a problem.  Because people

think that it's hopeless and will just take too long.  The rewards

don't justify the effort.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

and who knows?  I might actually be able to scratch out another area for you

all while I spiff up the other one :)

Hi

 

Here is the way to put the play time back to players ...

the command is set char 'name' hour 'time'

time is in sec ... so you've to do time * 3600 .

it was like the best hours of it, i think we need some

new immortals since alot of 'em disapeard ...

I agree with Jacki.  Before the last crash was when we had the highest turn

out of players.  With two creators who play frequently, and a few promotions 

or new imms we've got a solid base.  Everyone who has ever played says they

like this MUD, but always complained that there were never any immortals

who could help them.  Now that that is fixed I think me and Jacki

could turn this place around.

I've got an idea to make the clan system more interesting.  If we

advertize for a few dedicated builders, and some imms who are willing

to spend time giving quests and trivia.  We can make this MUD as 

appealling to anyone as any other.

I firmly believe that this mud can make it.  I think you should have a 

little faith in your creation, and trust that everyone will do what they

can to make it a better place.

I was also thinking about writing the web page.  Just have to 

brush up on my HTML (should take too long).  If you'd like to colaberate

I'd be open to it.  Also, Khald has offered to write the page.  I've seen

his work and it's pretty good.  It was simple, yet elegant and allowed for

ease of use.  We might want to consider allowing him to help.  Maybe to the

French part of the page (since we must have one) and I certainly don't know

french.  Anyhow...if any other players respond to my note I'll let you know

but for now looks like the three of us are it.

hi there

 

someone brought to my attention some peoples are using link dead immortals

to improve their skills (try try to kill us and they don't have to worry

about XP if they leveled ...)

 

in the meantime of a fix, get a really powerfull weapon so they are getting

dead very fast, set wimpy as high as possible and uhm .. what else

 

a little check should be added in the code, players shouldn't be allowed to

murder immortals

 

thx

Hi, just writing to say that Jacki and I decided that

It would be okay to give Trieze a try at being level

103.  Should he perform unsatisfactory he will be immediately

placed at level 1.  He has already had the general rules

of being an imm given to him, and has been explained his

duties as well as I can explain them to him.  Also I have told

Kay that he would most likely be able to be placed at 103

on the assumption that he makes a new character and keeps that

characters true identity hidden from the other players.

On a similar note.  I don't know exactly what farnham has been asking

for but I don't agree with him being a god or getting a new clan.

He was removed from leader of Satanis because of play unbecoming to

a leader, and I feel that this transgression has made it apparent

that he cannot be allowed into positions of power.

Hi

 

Here is my problem ... farnham, treize and an other guy i forgot his name

are played by same people. Farnham is a common character for treize and

...

So what do you want to do ... putting treize lvl 103 ... Khaldryck wants

to become imm too.

Ok for Kay, let him create a new char after gimme the name of it) i'll put

him lvl 103.

 

But for Treize and farnham i really don't know ( i've to know first whose

character they are.

 

So Bye all

See, I specifically don't want Farnham to be an imm.

I had not concidered that Treize would probably let Farnham 

use his imm character when he wants.  Now that I think of it

I can see that that would likely happen, and that would be no good.

So I withdraw my support for Trieze being an immortal (how dramatic).

Thanks for listening.

hi folx

 

like charun, it never comes to my mind that Treize could be sometimes

played by Farnham .. in that eventuality, it's better not to advance him

 

i'm all with you for advancing Kay (as a new char and not known by other ppls)

 

now for a more personal stuff,

seytan, set /home/seytan o-rwx car on peux downloader le mud si on a un access

a barney (genre access ftp comme moi)

j'en ai profit pour prendre la derniere version de la source dessus, et l'ai

compile sur mon bsd .. ca marche.. donc je vais pouvoir faire des patch pour toi

.. comment je te donne les patchs ?
