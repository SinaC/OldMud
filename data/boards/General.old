It would be easier if we got gold instead

of silver from the questmaster.  We wouldn't

get weighed down and we wouldn't have

to take extra time out to get it changed.

Subject Introduction to me.~
Text
Suddenly, you notice a small, furry humanoid next to you.

"Hello. I am Zarn. I didn't mean to startle you. Unfortunately,

I don't always remember that other races don't have the sharp

senses we do." He sits down, and eats some meat while continuing

the conversation.

 

"As you might have noticed from my light armor and the lack

of weapons, I am a monk. Perhaps not a very wise and skilled

one for the moment, but that is something I intend to see to

shortly."

 

He fidgets for a moment, scratching himself intensely behind

one ear. You notice he seems almost frantic in his movements.

Thinking back, you remember someone saying something about

their magically enhanced speed. It's one thing to be told

that a race has magically enhanced speed, and quite another

to see it with your own two eyes!

 

Yawning a bit, Zarn shows small, but pointed fangs. Absent-

mindedly, he hunts for one elusive piece of meat stuck in

his teeth with one long claw. Suddenly, he whirls around,

and stares at you. He seems almost... startled?

 

"What? Are you still here? Hmm... Oh well. Suffice to say

that I intend to be around, and that I hope to be up with

the wise and mighty when I have advanced far enough along

the Path of Enlightenment." He vaguely gestures to his yellow

sash that he has tied around his waist. Vanishing into the

undergrowth at the side of the road, you can almost make out

what he is mumbling as he disappears... Something like "one

day this will be black..." or something like that.

I just wanted to say that i love this mud,but i'm bored of killing the same mob

to level and be alone on th mud...not even an immortal or a little newbie to

also,i stunned by the trivia one can gain if he plays during the night !

it's not that i'm jealous,but there is no way of gaining trivia when i'm playing

and i often play 6 hours a day ! 

Maybe it's not so much,but i think it's quite a good quota of hours !

So can immortals be assigned to connect during the afternoon here in belgium

so they can help those few players that can play during the night 

and be overpowered by those night player ! (not in xp but in special eq gained

by trivia points )

If there is reimbursement for impossible quests, let

Neuromancer island today, 1 to ghost town where the

target was in a no kill room (great target eh?). And

previously to the stables in the amazon area before

Hi all

I just want to inform everyone that our teacher (the webmaster of our school)

will cut the access to the mud....

So lots of players won't be able to connect anymore :(

Sadly i'm one of those players ,my budget can't allow me to buy a modem and pay

the communication 

If you have any suggestion to help us,that would be welcome

because i don't see what to do without any access to my favorite mud 

I see only one thing that should work ...but it would need a test before

It's to change the access port of the mud...

I know Sinac can put it on port 9000

I don't think the teacher will forbid access to the whole server as 

barney.vpresence.com is not mud only !!

so i hope him to only cut the access to port 4000

well i can't tell anymore ....cause i don't know more !

All i can say is that we can't connect to BUG anymore too !

SO the teacher is really able to forbid us partial access to muds :(

 

Please help us found a counter-mesure to that nasty teacher .....

as people connecting from the ISE are nombrous 

I know we're about 15 and perhaps more ...

So if no help is found ....that would be a great lost ...

At least it's what i think ....

Text
Hi,

WARNING, WARNING, WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

Some brilliant person, or some malicious bug, has

attached the entrance to the prison to the Drow

city. I see no warning regarding the prison, and 

was made aware that today several people 

encountered Grug wandering the drow city (

most probably after he killed whoever opened

his cell door and let him out). Until someone

decides that this is not an appropriate placement

for level 100+ mobs, I suggest you avoid opening

doors in Drow City, esp if you wander into a long

hallway on the east side. If you scan something

called Grug, AVOID it, unless you are a remort

or are level 80something and enjoy a challenge

(and probably an alignment change).

 

To whatever powers that are, please place the

prison off a more appropriate area, like maybe

off anonpolis?

Okay...All you high level guys

If you really need a stomping ground, I will connect Necromancer Island to Fim.

Realize that it is only about half way complete (If that much)

There are certain limits on where you can go.

If you find yourself standing at the chimney DO NOT GO UP.

Not only do I not want you to go up there because I am building.

But because you will proably get stuck up there.

Also realize that I always put equipment in last, and mob scripts

after the equipment, so neither of those are there (but will be in

the future).  I will keep it connected until another high level area

comes up, or I finish the area (at which point it would be connected

at its correct points).

I hope this makes it a little easier on you all.

Subject Regarding remorting...~
Text
Hi,

Some have asked me about remorting. I am about to

do my second remort, so thought I'd offer some

overall comment on what I have experienced.

 

First, it took me 180 hours to remort the first time

I am now at 248 hours. This means of course my

second remort was much much faster than 1st.

So anyone having a hard time with their first

class take heart, it gets easier (maybe a bit

more boring in some ways). 

 

When you remort, you keep your stats (your

cast 'giant str' , wis, int, con, dex) and you can overtrain

in your new class. Your hp/mana/movement are

reset. You keep your questpoints, all eq

you were wearing is donated. You become

a level 1 in your new class. Overtraining

in your new class means you can add 2

training points to the stat that is primary

for your new class. In my case, I went from

a max of 21 con as a monk to 23 con as

a remorted monk into ranger. This allows

my max con to be 30 when properly equipped.

 

All your skills/spells that you know will be

available to you, as well as the new ones in

your new class. They are available to you

at the lowest common level between the

two classes. If you had it before, its at the

percent it was at when you remorted.

 

You keep your pracs and trains as well.

Any spells affecting you still affect you

when remorting (so cast nice high level

spells freshly on yourself just before

you type remort).

 

It's also alot of fun, hope it answers some

questions (btw, remort is at level 101, not

100, so your goal is to be 101:-).

Text
Odd thing happened today, 

I had built up 3 trains to buy the shield block skill, which is

available to my class and is low enough level for me to have been

able to use it.

However, after I bought the skill (shield block), the trains disappeared

and I never was given the skill!!

If anyone could offer explanation on what I did wrong, or help with 

reclaiming my lost trains, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks!

When you type trivia to get a list of things you can buy with your points, one

of the things that should be listed, but isn't is a custom weapon...

Subject Problems connecting...~
Text
Hi,

I was sick with a bad flu, and took about a week off.

Toward the end of the week, I tried occasionally to

log on here, sadly I kept failing, either the system was

down, or I'd get message like connection refused.

Has the mud been suffering a flu, or is there some

other problem with my connecting related to where

I am? I'd like to continue my play, but for example

I was linkdead after just under an hour yesterday

and couldn't reconnect through the entire evening.

Anyway, I'm going to bed now, nice though to see

the link is back up:-) If there is an administrative

problem with my IP addr please let me know. My

email account is alpha@ct1.nai.net

 

thanks

Zap,

Don't worry about connecting last night...  I tried to connect last

night and I couldn't get through, even when trying to for over an hour.  I

to clear that up.

 

Good luck connecting at a different time,

....nobody has answered my note.

 I know you gur

I know you guys are from belgium, but i didn't know you were...how shall I say

.....oh yeah.....RUDE!!!!

 

All I ask is a response...I mean damn it's not like I am just so player who

reached level 40.

 

I had remort to ranger, psionic, and thief...not to mention I was a monk.

I had four mystery eq. and I was about to level again.  I would think

that you would take the time to respond to my note.

 

When can we meet on the mud so I can get all my stuff back...i.e. Level and

Mystery eq.  I don't think it's all that much to ask.  If it is than at least

tell me.  Note me...do something except ignore me.  That is why you lose players

 

You guys ignore so much and are hardly around.  and I know you are busy but

you can at least send out a note now and then to confirm you exsistance.

 

So I ask again... Seytan or Oxtal or Sinac...When can I meet one of you on the

mud so I can regain my levels...remorts...trains...prac...and mystery eq.

 

ANY ANSWER WOULD BE APPRICIATED...even if you tell me to get lost...at least

answer me....I think I deserve that much.

Last I knew I was level 4, now I'm back to 106...

I don't know how it happened.

Just writing this to say sorry that I was gone so long.

Studing for finals, and being promoted at work sort of has that

effect.  Not to mention the fact that this place was dead for so 

long.

 

Like I said, just saying I'm back and will be try my hardest to get

everything back in order.  I hope we didn't lose to many, perhaps

a sound off to let everyone know they're not the only player will

help (it'll also let me know I'm not an imm on an empty MUD).

For all of you who find it an impossible task to escape the mists

under the castle in Necromancer Island I have some news.  Until now

It was an impossible task, with no clues and the designed escape route

was blocked.  I have fixed all that, now it is merely really hard.

It is possible, there are clues, and the way out works.

Enjoy solving the puzzle, and as with all the castle puzzles.

DON'T SHARE ANSWERS!!

Just so you know, tonight i had a little altercation with the plague boys.

well...zhar thought he could kill me and so i killed him after shrugging

off his backstab, then i slept him for good measure, but they complained

and promised not to attack me again so i woke him.  well...the 4 of them

called me to healer and what did they do?  they attacked me...all of them

hit me, 2 of them backstabbed me...so i killed them all and now here

they are with there 102 hour sleeps.  I'm sorry but they deserved it, they

are stupid and should not mess with me...please don't wake them..they can

use the sleep.  Thor and Zhar are of course no longer TheKlan.

All of you take this as a warning, do not mess with me because you will

regret it, I'm not an asshole but i will do what it takes to defend myself

and i have every right to.  Good day to you all...or should i say good night

Hi folkx

 

i think we should keep the mud open, the problem was the lack

of online immortals .. that's why we lost a dozen active players

but now that we have 2 creators online, that can do almost anything

i think this problem is fixed !

 

since we're botch (charun and me) online every days (and for hours)

i think the mud will just start to grow now ...

Subject This MUD and it's possible shutting down~
Text
This is how I see it.  I would rather the mud not shut down.  But I would 

understand if you did it.  You obviously don't have the time for the mud so

why bother.  If you still want to keep the mud that is your decision.  If you

want to disband it because people left...well that was your fault.  Not only

were you not here but when you were you did not respond to peoples notes.

I am note saying you have to respond to each one personally.  But you could

have written a note that said something to let people know you were trying to

do something about the aftermath of the crash.

 

As for Jacki and Charun being enough to take care of us all...sure I believe so

but I also know of an unsung hero that should be added to that list.  ROLAND.

 

I hear all this damn praise(and I do like Jacki and Charun) about how Jacki and

Charun are so great and how they are always on trying to help and make the mud

a better place.  What it seems some people have forgotten is that Roland was on

plenty.  Roland helped plenty.  Roland tried to make this a better place but

either got shot down or just plain out not answered.  Ex:  Mob Progams...it is

nice that Oxtal wants to make his own but he has been trying for a year and has

not finished.  Probably never will cause none of the imms have time for this 

mud.  The whole reason Roland have not built a serious area is because he was

waiting for this Mob Program.  How do I know all this you say??  Roland is my

roommate and I was able to listen to him bitch about how he would be able to

do so much with a mob program....hell...i still don't understand the whole

thing about mob programs cause hell if I know how to code...I just play.

 

Anyway point of this whole thing is...you have the people to keep this mud up

if you want.  But in the end it is your money.  Spend it how you wish.

I personally would keep up a mud I have to pay for if I can't spend time on it.

 

In the end yes, I would like to be able to continue playing here.  I would like

to eventually get all of the remorts under my belt.  If you do decided to end 

the mud then so be it...know that I had lot of fun and it was neato.

Kaine makes a very good point.  Roland seems to be left out when ever people

think about who did what on the Mystery.  I personnally feel that Roland is

the single best Imm we've had.  He was always far more level headed, and 

much better at solving problems than I was.  I always looked up to him, as

the leading person on the mud, and felt that his word was law.

I'm not sure what else to say, other than that.

...Damn I can't think of a good ending, I guess...

Roland was the best everyone here had, I think that that should be remembered.

Text
Hi,

Please keep the mud open. I also agree Roland was a

very important reason the mud continued for a long time.

I know without him I wouldn't be here now. 

 

I also suggest, class improvements be considered.

Some new skills/spells would be nice. I know building

cast infra ms important (and it is), but so is continued updates

to the class/race code. 

 

Fourth attack for warriors perhaps? Second dual attack

(allowing dual weapons 2nd attacks?)??

 

How about remove alighment for mages or clerics?

Shadowwalk for thieves? There must be many

possible improvements in spells/skills which we

could have added. It'd be nice to see one added

now and then. Right now, it seems to me warriors

could use some improvement, maybe fourth attack

and enhanced (dual?) parry? (perhaps enhanced

dodge for thieves/monks?) 

 

Anyway, the mud is nice, if it's to close, perhaps

it could be offered to someone else for hosting

elsewhere.

 

Regards

Subject As if we needed to discourage MORE new players...~
Text
Ok,

Who is the genius who increased the queen guards

tunics outside the amazon palace to level 65 from

level 0? Ya know they were a nice item to provide

new players, do we really need to discourage new

players, or limit assistance older players can offer?

 

Regards

cela fait 3 fois que farnham me tues alors qu'il me reste moins de 200 xp pour

passer de level. Cela a pour consequence, etant donne qu'il me tue en boucle,

que je dois a chaque fois recommence mon level completement.

La derniere fois que cela c'est produit c'etait le 19 janvier 1998 aux environs

de 15H20. Aussi j'aimerai qu'un imm me donne ce level.

Merci d'avance,

 

Olivier

farhnam arrete de faire chier maintenant ....y en a marre de tes notes qui 

n'ont aucun rapport avec le mud ...mais seulement avec toi ...

tu trouves pas que les immortels te font assez de cadeau comme ca ??

alors t'arretes d'ecrire tes notes stupides ...ou ecris les en personnel

tu sais ...ill y a d'autres board que le general ...alors essaies les

 

some words in english for those who don't understand above :

i find farhnam abuse of the general channel for things that have 

nothing to do with us ...or for the goodness of the mud ...so i

wrote a note to express myself ...

thanks for listening
