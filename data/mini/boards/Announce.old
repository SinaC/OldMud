Well, thanks to the hard work of the Warden, several of the realms'

nastiest criminals have been rounded up and sent to Prison. These

prisons are very, very dangerous and should only be visited by the

very foolish, or very powerful. The prison is located north of Midgaard.

The prison is almost full, the Warden is currently chasing 2 more to fill it.

Have fun,

.

Hi

 

I don't know or to tell you thqt but ... we don't know if we'll continue 

with this mud. The reasons are : we have no time (it's why we had 2 times

problems with pfiles).

Like you see there is not so much people on, and we'll not get anymore

players.

So i ask you your opinion, what do you want : continue or shut the mud down.

(you'll be more helped by charun and jacki wha are promoted to level 109

but ..... is it enough.

So write us notes ....

 

Bye 

 

Seytan

I don't even know if I should be announcing this.

Because I'm sure Seytan had a reason for posting the note to Immortals only.

So, if he has then forget you ever saw this.

However, Seytan is looking for someone to write the MUDs

web page.  If you are !GOOD! at this (have experience in which people have

said the page was cool), and would like to help the MUD out a good deal

then please send a PERSONAL (so that general doesn't get cluttered) note to me 

Jacki, Seytan, Sinac, or Oxtal.  Expressing your interest, giving a bit of

info on your idea for the page, and (if possible) the address of pages you

have made before.

-->Charun "Thank you for supporting your Mystery"

p.s. - Seytan, if you really didn't want everyone to know about this

I give my deepest apologies, and I will post a counter note immediately.

Hi all,

 

Sorry for my extended absence, my schedule has been crazy.

I have opened my Dinosaurish area. It is for players from

60 to 100..so lower players, Beware!! You can get to the

area by roaming around near the Amazon village.

Have fun and note me with any complaints, praises, etc.

Again, it's nice to be back and seeing everyone again.

Again, it's nice to be back and seeing everyone again.

P.S.--I am not setting the area up as 100% accurate..

I have changed some of the dinosaurs' habitats, time periods, etc.
