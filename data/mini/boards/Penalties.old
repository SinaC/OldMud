I have made Farnham and Ilmalter LONER.

I caught Farnham killing Ilmalter (sleeping and link dead).  He said they were

friends (meaning it wasn't revenge/defense), and that Ilmalter had killed

Farnham (meaning that he had allowed Ilmalter to kill him for xp).  

Killing for clan mates xp is ILLEGAL, killing a link dead individual is ILLEGAL.

For this I have decided that Farnham and Ilmalter may only be LONER.

If either is caught doing this again then they are to be completely disallowed

from being in a clan (They can't be loner).  Farnham is NOT to be restored to

leader of Satanis or be a member of Satanis in any capacity.

Nor is he allowed any rights or priviledges of being a member of SATANIS.
