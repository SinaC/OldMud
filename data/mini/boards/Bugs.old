Subject bug in my exp?~
Text
#verbose

greetings immortals,

it is at this point very hard for me to gt any experience, let me explain...

i played untill level 9 at wich point i got a raise to 14, being the level i

was before the pfile-wipe. now at level 14 i got some more equipment and went

on my way to get some experience. Things i tried:

Socks in Lennies were 'Do you feel lucky, punk?' 2 of them made me flee three

times (i couldn't 'cure serious' in time) i got them down eventually and got 20

and 25 exp for them. i tried some other mobs too, that were 'The perfect match!'

and got 7 to 9 exp. (quite low for a perfect match?) then a clannie of mine

spelled me up and i went on the road again .. did an 'Easy' kill for 6 exp

(right sounds logical) and a 'Laughs at you mercilesly' .. for this last kill,

as i said, i was heavilly spelled up, having more hitroll, and enough damroll

to do the double damage as normal (and even better AC too). I drained my total

mana to heal me during the high and while fleeing once. result? I got the

enourmous amount of 12 experience points.

<high 2 lines up should have been fight -guess i'm heavilly dislectic>

now maybe it is this thing that pulls down your exp because you played few

hours? i dont think so, i played 10 hours at level 14, while Gylian was level

45, having played 12 hours, she was doing ok and leveled 2 times today at least.

i asked several people (mortals) how this could have happened, they had no clue.

they think there is nothing wrong with my equipment either.

well how could it be my equipment, i get peanuts exp for a mob that

'Laughs at you mercilessly' .. the comparison in levels does mean something

right?

Well thanx for reading (if you didnt give up halfway :)

and i hope you will find a sollution.

Text
Hi, I started a Nekojin thief, didn't selecte sneak in the

custom configuration, as it's supposed to be included

with the race. Entered the game, instead of sneak at

100%, no sneak at all:-(

 

Could some kindly imp fix this, both for new players

who come after me, and on my pfile (think it should

be 100% sneak:-)

 

Otherwise nice mud, but a bit emptyish:-(

Subject weaken vs giant str...~
Text
Hi,

On just about every diku mud varient, the weaken

spell continues long after the giant strength spell

to gain power. Thus at the moment a level 51 weaken

spell is taking 14 off my strength but my level 56

giant strength spell adds only 4 back.

 

I dont much mind giant strength being limited to +4,

but I'd like weaken to be similarly limited, or limited

to whatever giant str is +1 for example:-)

 

Regards

Subject bugged quests~
Text
Hi,

 

Ever notice some quests seem to require you to go to

non walkable places, yet you cannot gate?

 

Well here's an example, try to find the bay horse in

the amazon area. There seems to be a missing door

south and west of the stablemistress. Thus you can

gate to the bay horse, and you can walk back to

town without recalling, but you cannot walk to the

bayhorse as there is a missing west door south of

the stablemistress (try it you can walk east and get

to the stable entrance, but once you get by the 

stablemistress you cannot go west again).

 

Now how can anyone complete quests which

require gating? I believe I have seen no exit from

hell, the brady area, and the levelxx area (up to

level 40 (forgot the name)). Now hell and the masters

in the level area plus the amazon area are all

popular quest assignment areas. Can we either

lift the gate limitation during quests, or can we

make sure that all quests are doable by mortals

hoofing before we assign them:-) I have been

enlisted (and am pleased to help) summon others

who say get assigned to a hell target. I believe

this is very fair as there is no way I know to get

there by foot.

 

Please, allow gating during quests, allow summoning,

or assure all areas and all targets (like the bay horse)

are reachable by mortals walking.

 

Regards

Zap

I  am having troubles opening and unlocking doors located south.

Espacially when there is more than one door in a room.

The place where I am having the most difficulty is in the zoo.

I can open the cages on the north, east, and west.  But when I

try to open south, it tells me that is not a valid container.

Normally I can override this by typing open door/cage.

But when I do this, it calls the direction that is NOT south

as the default direction.

I happened to be in the shielding today and looked at it's exit list

when I noticed something.  All of the exits are one-way.

This wouldn't be a problem, except that they are all pointed out of

the level.

Making it impossible for people to get to it.  I don't know if that

is the way it is supposed to be or not, but I thought someone might

want to know.

Charun,

I looked at The Shielding exits. I changed one of the one-way

exits near Midgaard to two-way. Now there is a way reach The

Shielding area by going north of Midgaard's north gate. Thanks

for pointing out crazy exit thing. This fix is just a quick

one and i will be building nice connecting area to put between 

The Shielding and the Moria (north of Midgaard) areas.

Again, thanks

i don't know if it's a feature or a bug (a coder will tell it's a feature)

but the lore skill (even at 100%) is failing about 10 times before you can
