  Story = "Love is perhaps the most unpredictable force in the universe.  It can

cause drastic and unpredictable changes in people and in lands.  Cities have

risen and fallen in the name of Love.  Monarchs have been wed to peasants

and the dead brought back to the land of the living all in the name of Love.


As it was from the beginning, no creature enjoys being alone.  The entity

that was the universe created the world to assuage its own loneliness.  It

was from this same need that Aislara, Goddess of Love, grew.  Aislara was a

personification of the instinct inherent in all people.  She represents love

in all its personifications: love between parent and child, love between

friends, love for king and country, and, of course, romantic love.


Aislara herself can often be unpredictable and mercurial in temperament, as

she embodies the full mixture of emotions that go along with love.  It is

believed that for every soul there is another that is a perfect match for

them, and Aislara is often called upon to bless the unions of those who have

found their mates.
