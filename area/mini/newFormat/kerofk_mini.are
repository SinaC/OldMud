   And so, the history of Kerofk...
   The city of Kerofk originated in the mind of Builder_5, as a major
city for use in a role-playing game he was running at the time (a
heavily modified version of Powers & Perils--a very out-of-print
Avalon Hill game).  Amanda Eterniale was a player in this game, and
loved the city.
   About this time, Amanda received an invitation to build on the
now-defunct AlbertMUD.  She was taught how to build by an imp
named MJPrime there, and her first creation was the city of Kerofk,
in honor of Builder_5\'s game.
   AlbertMUD died in a fairly nasty manner, and about half a year
later, Amanda convinced one of the imps to email her her areas.  She
gave them to Builder_5, smiled, and said,
   "Edit these?  Please?"
   Builder_5 took the better part of 3 months to edit, fix, and convert
these files into a version more suitable for a public release.  This
is what you have now.
   Both of us hope you enjoy this area, over a year in the making...
