Looking around the room it is easy to tell that some sort of mystical activity
goes on here.  In the center of the room you notice a small round table upon
which a clear glass globe sits in the middle.  Strange cards are strewn over
the table, the images on them are nothing you can recognize.  A sign hangs
crookedly from the edge of the table.  The only way out is back to the south
where you entered this tent.

indescribable, neither male or female and you can't make out what it is saying.
The path continues on to the north and to the east you can make out a shape of
a small tent.

something that you can not place fills the air.  There is something here.....
But where?  There is a small door leading west to a dark room and to the south
you may leave back to the path.

baby elephant is sleeping on one of the piles of hay waiting for its mother to
return from the act in the circus.

rings where the acts take place.  Vendors walk the aisles selling various
novelties.  A few clowns have made their way up to the seating area to give the
children a thrill.  Laughter sails through the air almost as gracefully as the
man on the trapeze.  To the east you can see the main event in the center ring,
while to the north will lead you back to the entrance.

precariously on a thin rope as he holds a long rod in his hands for balance.  
One miscalculation and his fate is sealed, hence the look of extreme

they are playing follow the leader walking around the large circle.  While yet
another has a young beautiful girl riding gingerly on its back.  To the south

middle of the floor.  A black velvet high back chair rests in the corner along
side a small yet intricately carved table.  This must be the ringmasters
private quarters for only he could afford such luxury in the circus.  The door
to the north is the only exit.
