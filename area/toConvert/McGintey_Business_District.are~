Western Bridge~
   The bridge ends here, heading south into the main part of the city.  Looking
down, you see that the bridge you stand upon must have been a huge undertaking,
the anchors which hold the bridge to the cliff face are by themselves bigger
than you.  You may enter into the city or head north back over the bridge into
the wilderness.

Cliffside Inn~
   This inn looks to be one of the main rest spots for travellers who stay in
McGintey Cove over night.  The place is not all that flashy, but it always has a
warm fire at night, plenty of ale, and the beds upstairs are always very
comfortable.

large rack full of maps and brochures which tell in great hype and detail all

Samuel Faarza's~
   This exclusively drunken brawling tavern looks to be a popular hangout for
wayward travellers who need to shake the road dirt off their boots and take out
any frustrations they may have felt in their travels on each other.  Samuel, the
owner and operator, an ex-gladiator from the pits, never seems to mind any
fights in his business.  It is even rumored that he sometimes starts them
himself!

McGintey Bank and Depository~
   One must wonder why and how most banks come to receive such opulence.  True,
there is a lot of money which passes through a bank's hands, but most of that
money does not belong to the bank.  Wise investments and purchases do yield a
profit over time, however all banks seem to have way more than enough money for
themselves.  This bank is no exception.

The Weapon Shop~
   This is probably the worst place in town to buy weapons of any sort unless
you don't care about your fighting skills or you are a mage (since they can't
fight like real men, anyway).  The proprieter of the shop is a sniveling worm of
a kid who's rich father bought him the shop only in an attempt to keep the kid
occupied away from home.  Hence, the poor quality of weapon sold here, and the
high prices, which are that way because of the low volume.

The Parchment Place~
   This run-down, hole in the wall, flea bag dive is home to a failing business
which is failing only because of it's lack of variety and it's competition
located in the guild area.  The scrolls offered are of fine quality and work
with almost every use, but the scrolls offered are not popularly needed.

East Main~
   The road heads north into the bazaar or south into the main section of town.
To the west is a very ill-kept business with a faded and peeling sign hanging
crooked over the door proclaiming it the Parchment Place.  The way is impassable
to the east, a steep hill runs up for quite some distance to the Wharf, the high
class section of town.

Fatima's Footwear~
   Fatima seems to run a orderly, neat store.  All the shoes are kept clean and
shined, all placed strategically on shelves so as to give the customer the best
angle on them.

The Jeweler~
   Many exotic jewels lay in glass displays on velvet cushions of contrasting
color.  The colors are dazzling to the eye, and the temptation to rob this poor
schmuck is almost overpowering.

The Watering Hole~
   Barrels are stacked neatly along the north wall, canteens hang from straps
along the south wall, and behind the counter are flasks and cups of varying
shapes and colors.  Some kind of large machine, most probably used to distill
sea water into drinking water sits back behind the counter.

   The streets head off in all directions.  To the eastand north, the street
goes further into the business sections of McGintey Cove.  South of here begins
the area of town known as the Docks, where all the sea vessels are built and
most sailors stay when in port.  To the west the street heads into the Guild
area.

sells all manner of hand wear.  The street here seems a bit dirtier, less kept
up than the streets at the north end of town near the gates, almost dingy.

South St~
   You have begun your ascent into the upper reaches of the high status section
of McGintey Cove, known as the Wharf.  A warning to all who come this way.  No
thievery is allowed here, no crimes are allowed to be committed, and all prices
are very high.

   The street is definately a bit less kept up than the streets to the north.  
The road leads generally downhill, sometimes down steps toward to the sea shore
where sailors roam about, looking for food stuffs or women, as is their wont.

Gloveworks~
   Racks are scattered throughout the room, all with various sizes and shapes of
gloves hanging from them.  In cabinets and on shelves are many types of
gauntlets and glaives which would be too heavy to hang from a hook on the racks.
It smells of frehly oiled metal and leather in here, a delightful combination
for any seasoned adventurer such as yourself.

   The road heads downhill into a much more scented section of town, the Docks.
It smells of sea weed, raw fish and dirty bodied men of the sea.  The roads are
covered in dirt and grime and the farther south you get, the worse the roads
get.  Hard to believe that some of more high class people actually come through
here.

McGintey Teleporters~
   This establishment runs in direct competition with the Boat Station, being
that this is a seaport town and all.  The prices offered here are substantially
less than those found in most other towns, and the choices of travel are much
less limited than the other, smaller inland towns.

McGintey Center Square~
   This area has been set aside for patrons of the bazaar and the common
citizens to have a place for a peaceful rest away from all the noise and hustle
of the city.  Pity that so many of the less fortunate make it their permanent
place of residence.  Ah well, it's still a fine place to relax.

town.  Monthly meetings are still held by either the town mayor or the immortal
sponsor for this town.  The upper reaches of this fine place hold the various
