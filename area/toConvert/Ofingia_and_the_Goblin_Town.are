innkeeper reilly~
Reilly the Innkeeper~
The innkeeper watches for customers and drinks imported Scotch.
~
   Reilly doesn't keep this inn open by sitting and watching the goblins invade!
He looks more like a hobo than an innkeeper but you can at least see that he is
wearing a huge Scotch sword at his side.  He is also drinking from a huge bottle
of Scotch whiskey, probably not the single-malt variety.

Pater Vinci~
Pater Vinci greets you as you pass by.
~
   Pater Vinci did not bear a weapon in the good old days, but now the goblins
ought to avoid him, because the good priest fought for King Korbor before he
took holy orders, and still carries a sturdy club.

Zeb Rykalp~
Zeb Rykalp, sheriff of Ofingia, watches you closely.
~
   You had better keep on Zeb's good side.  He has few qualms about roughing up
the Midgaarders, and is ever-vigilant for evil.

Dorig Foehammer~
Dorig the dwarf welds bars together with a 10 pound hammer.
~
   He is too strong for you to beat easily in a fight, and if he had a beer or
two in him Dorig would be invincible.  At least, he would think himself
invincible.

Joel Kreb, the village carpenter, rests with an axe close at hand.
~
   That axe he has has a long spike opposite its blade, and you do not think it
is intended for wood, but for flesh and bone, particularly of goblin-kind.

A stout halfling shopkeeper eyes your moneybag with a glinting eye.
~
   Guard your wallet carefully!  Rumor has it that Maxtrum rarely runs out of
money, which would be wonderful, if only his customers didn't so often find
their pockets lighter after leaving his store, though they bought nothing.

   Churt notices you gagging as you enter his shop and peers at you with some
surprise.  He is a powerful wizard, having practiced such great spells as
`Churt's Irresistable Retch' and `Word of Command: Go away, I...  ' Well, never
mind that one.

   She is not a noblewoman, but is a lady all the same.  After all, lady means
`loaf-kneader' just as lord means `loaf-ward' in the old Anglo- Saxon tongue.  
She has bashed more goblins with her rolling pin than Jewish rye has caraway
seeds.

saved the world from destruction, but there isn't much need for heroes in
peacetime.  You can see Sara's long spear hung on the wall where she can
instantly reach it.

"Jewel of Lonoya", would not sparkle as it does in Korbor's crown if he was not
so busy.  The old man really hates adventurers who don't clean up after
themselves.

                       The Legend of Nambor.            
    In days now forgotten to any but the living God, there lived a
    valiant Man, Nambor by name, who dared enter the evil tunnels 
    in the bowels of the mountains.  From Symtoto he came, through
    paths untrodden, until after great struggle he found a shaft 
    leading down into deep darkness.  But that was the start of poor
    Nambor's trials, for he found the entrance was too high to leave
    through. Now must he roam the tunnels of the evil creatures that
    gnaw the rocks of the Underdark, till God shows him an escape 
    from the tunnels, or from this world.
    And bravely he went forth, ever climbing deeper, sword clutched 
    in hand.  And 'tis said by the elves that he saw there many a 
    marvel; rocks that turned into vile beasts when touched, and 
    unseen creatures that lurked in the shadows.  And some there are
    that say he escaped at last, but others say he never left, but
    died in the dark, broken sword still in his hand.
    And now these tunnels are full of goblins, yet still some of the
    nameless things Nambor fought remain.  Where now is one willing
    to enter and discover the ancient hero's fate? Where now is the
    hero, to save Lonoya from the goblins?

A Narrow Crawlway~
   Ouch!  You can barely squeeze through this passage, which is only a foot and
a half high.  It was also hidden behind a stone block; that is, no doubt, the
reason the goblins have not tried to follow you, being too weak to move it.  
You, however, can still shove it aside, should you wish to slither north.  The
wide passage to the south looks much, much more inviting, however.

   *Shattered Farmlands of Ofingia
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova
Level: 8 - 15
94 rooms
13 mobs
27 objs
Connector Zones: Ofingia
After making Ofingia a Hometown on Dibrova and having it basically in
the middle of BFE, I decided it might be a good idea to stick a zone
in that would be close in proximity to Ofingia and have some mobs
available that were low level, made just for players fresh out of the
Newbie Zones.
This is not a very exciting area, I will be the first to admit. There
are a number of same-room descrips in this one that make the zone
slightly blah. The objs are all intended to be for lower level players,
same as the mobs. The plot is supposed to feed off the already existing
plot that Ofingia had from the start:
The goblins have the town under seige, they have ransacked these
farmlands in an attempt to prohibit the town from having any food
supplies. They constantly come in and loot and burn everything they
can find to further the town's losses. The Lord of Jareth has sent in
a retinue of his finest to help quell the threat, however they are
unaffective against the numbers of goblins in the area.
Hope you like it.

A Tunnel in the Mountains~
   It is very easy to walk here.  A forgotten river has carpeted this cave soft,
sandy clay, and streaked the walls with frozen ripples.  The north wall has a
small crack in it, and to the south this wide tunnel becomes higher, and
slightly narrower.  A shadow on the west wall implies a tunnel mouth, leading
out of your lantern's reach.

A Tunnel in the Mountains~
   What a lovely place!  It is not wide here - your shoulders fit, with little
room for company.  You judge the cavern roof to be at least 70 feet above your
head.  Crystal formations in the rippled walls split torchlight into countless
sparks of flame, reflected from the quartz veins which embroider the stone in a
timeless brocade.  The walls are mainly vertical, but taper outwards enough to
support a block of breakdown, hanging like Damocles' sword, fifteen feet up.  I
doubt it will fall, however.  The tunnel is lower but wider to the north.  A
small stream trickles from a tiny hole, high up on the wall, to exit through a
small tunnel to the south.  To the east, a larger cave continues to a bend.  
That boulder troubles you.  Anxiously you examine its support, and notice some
writing on the wall.  There is a NEWLY CARVED SIGN here.  Read it!

A Narrow Ledge~
   The stream plunges downward, to join another, which foams and rages far below
you in a deeply cleft canyon.  You hear nothing above the water's roar.  Like a
cat you tread on a spray-wet ledge only six inches wide.  Not a nice place.  
You do not look down as you continue.  A traveler must count courage among his
baggage, no?  Perhaps you will be repaid.  Through the mists to the south you
glimpse a golden gleam.  To go there you must creep cautiously along a ledge too
narrow for a surefooted cat, and slippery as fish skin.  It is not too late to
turn back!  A narrow crevasse leads down the cliff, but only an acrobat could
turn round and descend it.  Your nose brushes an inscription.

The Tunnel's Entrance~
   O traveler from Midgard, your journey has not ended, but begun!  You are just
inside a cave entrance.  It stretches far into mountain-darkness.  Just to your
east, an underground stream leaves a lower cave.  If the the same water flows
inside the cave, it must have passed under your feet at a lower level, for it is
in a gorge seventy or more feet deep.  To your south you see the smooth line of
a road cutting the woods.  A sign is carved into the stone here.

The Ofintine Public Library~
   Here you may borrow, or buy, much of the great literature of Ofingia, which
sadly does not fill very many of the shelves here.  Once this library had many
more works, but the goblins have raided this town several times in the last few
years and burned or stolen most of those that were reported to be magical.  One
of the walls has a huge oil portrait hanging where there are no shelves.  
Looking about you, you are amazed at the number of books still left, but most
are poorly written works of popular fiction.  Alas!  There are some exceptions;
a map hangs on the wall, for instance.

there may be even more interesting things on the shelves than corn.  Why, on

   Like the rest it is a fragment:

The age of Iron came next; it is our present age. In these days men
dwindled both in stature and nobility still further from the Bronze
Age, so say the philosophers. They began forging their tools and 
blades of iron, and no longer wrote the great epics of the last Age.
Death still reigned, and reigns, over the world of men, cutting 
short their little works. How large they seemed! Yet all is not lost.
So says the philosopher:
              To the world that stumbles lost and lone,
              A king descends from heaven's throne. 
              Death by death is overthrown.

papyrus scroll fragment~
   Some ancient scribe has written a list of legendary weapons, of which  
only this tiny scrap remains.

The great warrior Highlander, it is said, bore a mighty claymore, the
equal of which is unknown to me.  I have heard it glowed brightly when
drawn, but I see no way this would be useful. The great smith Durgandon
forged it in the dwarven halls; its enchantment is opposed to any evil
and protects its wearer from harm, it is said.  I know not if this is
true. The blade is known to me only in legend; if indeed it ever was, 
it is now lost forever.  No word of Highlander has been heard for long.
Zebenak Rykalp of Wazen bears a sword made by the smith Dorig, of the
Foehammer clan.  Its name is Krat, or "Razor" in the Vallonian tongue,
named for its thinness, and its renowned edge.  It is supple steel,
but quite sturdy, and I have seen Zeb plunge it deep into an oak without
injuring the blade. Dorig is truly a great craftsman.

here, or in Venango.  The Sheriff has not retired his post; no, he moved here

are quite apt to bite something and throw it away, though it comes from a king's
board.  Grotesque green-skinned warriors of all sizes and degrees of hideousness
mill about, chewing on meat, whose origins you do not wish to know.  The east

and blows sparks everywhere replaces the bellows which work so well for dwarves,
and it is run by several sturdy trolls turning a horse-mill.  Slag heaps lie all
