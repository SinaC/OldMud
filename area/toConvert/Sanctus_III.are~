A Long Hallway~
   The hall stretches north and south.  Lanterns set in brackets along the wall
offer ample lighting.  The smokeless kerosene that is used leaves a strange
smell.  The Hall is bare, only a few small paintings cover the walls.  Clerics
have very little need for decorations of any kind.  A small waiting room is to
the west.

Clerics Avenue~
   The cobblestone road is in decent shape, though a few stones have been
overturned leaving gaping holes.  No wagons travel down this part of the city.
Everyone knows Clerics have no need anything besides what they can provide by
themselves.

dirt.  To the north you may enter the inner city towards the Temple of Sanctus
or go south towards the southern gate.  The southern half of the city consists
of the Magi's and Cleric' quarters.

Quarter.  Accidents have been known to happen around here.  People must be

Orcs, Goblins, more Demons.  Every creature imaginable.  Even fellow humans,

steam.  The air is musky and hard to breath.  A large fire fills the eastern
wall, pots of water are heating over it.  These baths are used only by the
Magi.  As people often say, cleanliness is next to godliness.

wall to wall.  Every rack made precisely to standard.  Every sheet a pristine
white, not a speck of dust can be found.  The Clerics of Sanctus lead a
disciplined life second to none, not even the army.

A Long Hallway~
   The barren walls and floors reminds you how the Clerics of Sanctus consider
decorations, desires, or any form of unnecessary wants a type of blasphemy.  
They dedicate their lives to helping others, never themselves.  Every one of
them would sacrifice their lives for that principle.

follows along the inner city wall just north of the Tower of the High Council.
Clerics Avenue continues north and south.  The Tower almost seems to glow
because of it's glaring whiteness.

Clerics Alley~
   Within the Cleric's Quarter an adventurer has very little to worry about.  
Even those would be vandals, pickpockets, and thugs shy away from this Quarter
because of their respect of the clerics.  To be a cleric is second only to
being a Master Magi.

   The southern section of the inner city wall crowds you from the north.  The
massive fortification of rock and mortar is impressive, rising at least two or
maybe three times your own height.  You can just make out a small walkway on
the top of the wall, too bad only the guards know where the entrance is.

Temple of Sanctus.  They look very similiar, except of course the Tower is much
smaller.  Far up in the tower you can see people walking by windows in white
flowing robes.  The healers within are known for their miraculous abilities in
restoring the wounded.

A few apprentice healers in flowing robes rush between the Temple and the

Quarter lies to the west while the Magi's Quarter is to the east.  Within their
centers rises the Tower of the High Council of Cleric's and the Tower of the
Magi respectively.

   The black Tower of the Magi casts an intimidating shadow over you and the
alley you walk in.  Within the tower lies many secrets that the average citizen
is not privileged enough to be told about.  Rumours abound, especially about
the Orb of Sanctum the gods left in the Master Magi's care.

window of the Tower of the Magi south of you.  The voices are too low to be

   The inner city wall is used to seperate the city into two seperate
battlefields.  In case of an attack by superior numbers the citizens will fall
back into the inner city as a last measure of defense.  Luckily, the army has
been very successful in protecting the city and it has never come to that.

oppressively.  The sounds of voices echo between the tower and the inner city

sore just to the east.  The Tower contains the fabled Orb of Sanctum, but few
are ever lucky enough to lay their eyes on it.

except for the constant bombardment of fireballs, lightning, and meteors by the
Magi.

cramped, too many things and too many people in one area.  The cooks look
overworked and ready to revolt.

clerics, wether it be healing in the tower or to settle disputes within the
Hall.

Very few are selected for this great honor, and even fewer ever achieve a
mastery in the art of restoring health.  Several old clerics are bestowing
their knowledge and wisdom to their students here.

live humans.

causing the young boy to instantly fall asleep, another cleric take the boys
arm which has been badly bruised and possibly broken and begins chanting
mysterious words.  The bruises fade away without a trace.

The Training Room~
   Several apprentices sit patiently waiting for their next lesson.  Classes
are held within this tower no matter what time of day.  The Magi are searching
relentlessly for the next Master Magi.  They are short by two and the five
existing are all old and nearly finished in their lives.

The Training Room~
   The Magi train within the tower as to help protect the city from invasion.
Though the army is normally the only intervention required to handle most
battles, the Magi are sometimes called upon to prevent heavy casualties or
counter any magical abilities the attackers may possess.

The Training Room~
   Several older students are sitting in on a class about the protective dome
that upholds the balance within the city.  You hear the mention of the Orb of
Sanctus and of how the gods bestowed it upon the Master Magi to preserve and
protect.  Without the Orb the city would surely fall.

   A Master Magi overlooks several students as they pass between themselves a
small flickering ball of light.  The Master Magi notices you watching and
motions you away.  No one disagrees with a Master Magi, at least no one that
wishes to live.

Magis Avenue~
   The street narrows here as it passes between the Tower and the Mansion.  
You can hear strange incantations coming from an open window in the black
tower, far above your head.  The Magi train young students within to take their
place, but fewer and fewer meet the requirements and actually survive the
training.

the windows.  Rugs of the colors of the Magi line the floors.  Everything is
spotless and well maintained.  Living here would be what many would consider is
living the good life.

hold themselves to be very prestigious and elegant.  No one would ever dare

walls are all plain white plaster with no decorations.  The room is used as an
emergency shelter in case a large number of casualties are incurred, more than
the Tower can handle.

The building is barren of any luxuries.  That is the way a Cleric must live,
without desires or wants.

multi-colored herbs swings in the gentle breeze.  The Tower rises far above
you, it's two spires reaching almost as high as the Temple.  In contrast the
Hall looks very mundane.

upon closer examination you can't see any grain within it.  Looking into the
stone you seem to lose yourself.  Peering further and further into the
blackness, you cannot tell wether it is a trick of the eye or some strange
magic at work here.  The center of the Magi's Quarter lies to the east.
