baker's assistant~
the baker's assistant~
An assistant to the baker is learning the trade.
~
   He sifts some flour with glazed over eyes that seem to be somewhere else.  
Obviously daydreaming of better things.  His white apron is covered in floor.
He stands a good six feet tall, all skin and bones.

the apprentice healer~
An apprentice healer helps any who are in need.
~
   He has devoted his life to selflessly aid those who are in need of either
physical or mental aid.  The clerics of Sanctus are well known for their aiding
those physically wounded, but are seldom known for their great prowess in the
emotoinal aid they give.

stablemaster~
the stablemaster~
The stablemaster is busily cleaning out the stalls.
~
   He looks and smells like the rest of the stables.  His clothes are the same
color and texture as the manure that he shovels into a wheelbarrow beside him.
He could definitely use a bath.  But he does know his horses and makes a living
selling, training, and breeding them.

has a marble bottom, which is clean enough to eat off from.  In the center of

look closely you can see that there is water streaming out from the mouths.  
What a neat idea!

The Northern Road~
   You find yourself standing in the middle of a very mysterious looking road.
Everything to the east appears to be dark and gloomy, giving you the feeling
that maybe you shouldn't have come here.  However, things in the west change
dramatically.  You can hear the shouts of soilders in training.  The road
continues to the north and south.

Thieves Avenue~
   You walk between the inner city wall and the warehouse.  The warehouse is
made from sturdy timber with a set of wide double doors that appear to open
outwards.  Wagon tracks lead right up to the warehouse.  This must be where
traders come to unload their supplies.

hidden somewhere within this building.  Of course only a fool would try to
steal from a bunch of thieves.

unloading, and sorting through all the supply crates live in this single room.
Mattresses that are shredded to pieces by rats and mice line one wall.  A small
washbasin, stool and bench are the only other luxuries these overworked brutes
own.

soldiers rush about.  You wonder why anyone would sign up for the army after
all the stories you've heard.

   A large intersection is before you.  If you go south, you will go into the
wonderful Temple of Sanctus.  To the east and west is a road that looks to wind
around the temple.  To the north you can't see anything but open road.  
Everything around is silent, making you feel all alone.

than Hazel herself.

the same material.  That must have been one of the many foul jobs given to new
recruits.

fires that put off no smoke.  The yellow fog overflows the top of one of the

encounter with a pickpocket.  A large warehouse to the east and the inner city

Magis Avenue~
   The streetlamps glow an unnatural white, upon closer examination you realize
they must be magical in nature since no oil you've ever seen burns that color.
The beautiful cobblestone road meanders north and south.  The Magi Mansion to
the east looks glorious.

The Reading Room~
   A large bookshelf is overburdened and looking about ready to collapse from
the hundreds of volumes of books it holds.  These are the chronicles of the
Magi.  Within them they hold the secrets of their mystical art.  A large sign
above the bookshelf warns anyone from attempting to touch the books.

The Dining Room~
   A large table with a silk cloth is set for the next meal.  Sparkling
silverware and spotless wine glasses all fill the majestic table.  Enough for
seven settings.  Two of the place settings are turned upside down.  Servants
rush about their work around you.

The Aundience Chamber~
   This is the room where the High Council meets with any who bring forth
problems.  The High Council will then vote and decide on a way to settle the
matter.  Their word is final and none ever disobey them.  They are respected
for their intelligence and wisdom.

A Long Hallway~
   Citizens may ask advice of the High Council in settling disputes among each
other.  The Hall is the only form of justice within the city besides the army.
Everyone respects the High Council for their devotion and wisdom towards what
is right.

Clerics Avenue~
   The inner city wall to your east consists of large boulders, that look to be
too big to move by any humans, and some sort of filler.  The wall rises at
least three times your height and you can not tell how thick it must be.  You
hear the sound of clanking armor and idle chat as guards on the wall above you
make their rounds.

The Southern Temple Circle~
   You've reached the southeastern intersection of the inner city.  The south
and west inner city walls merge here.  A set of stone stairs lead up into a
small lookout post above you.  The street turns here, wrapping around the
Temple of Sanctus.

   The cobblestone street continues to the east and west along the southern
wall of the inner city.  Small shops line the road to your north.  The Tower of
Sanctus, with it's single tall spire reaching to the heavens, looks
magnificient.  A style of workmanshi that has never been surpassed.

The Southern Temple Circle~
   The smell of fresh, and not so fresh, meat wafts in from the north.  A sign
swaying above the door in the breeze depicts a hunk of meat crosse with a
butcher's axe.  You can see an intersection just to the east where you can exit
the inner city or enter the Temple.

   The southern entrance to the Temple of Sanctus lies just to your north.  
You may also travel along the Temple Circle east and west.  To the south you
can exit the inner city and work your way into the Magi's or Cleric's Quarters.

   The smell of freshly baked bread assails your nostrils and makes your

Temple to the north or exit the inner city to the south.  The inner city wall

The Southern Temple Circle~
   Various shops surround the Temple of Sanctus to the east and west.  The
shops were moved within the inner city years ago.  All the shops seem to do
good business and the overall wealth of the city seems to be geared mostly to
the middle class.  Only a few have achieved poverty or great wealth within the
city.

Magis Avenue~
   The stark inner city wall to the west bears a sharp contrast to the
luxurious mansion to the east.  The Magi have trained hard to become very
powerful within the city and have begun living the life that shows it.  Unlike
the Clerics who do not believe in worldly possessions the Magi surround
themselves with it.

An Elegant Hall~
   The walls are covered in some sort of drawing that stretches from floor to
ceiling.  It depicts a battle with the Master Magi obliterating hundreds of
demons by calling down lightning and hurling fireballs.  The demons look
vaguely familiar, like something you remember from a dream.

where the servants and students sleep and, from the looks of the table and what

of cards lies in the center of the table waiting to be dealt.

guidance of the High Council.  The High Council has come to be the law of the
land here.
