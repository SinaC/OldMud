woman female pretty~
the female~
A pretty female sits on the edge of a table, talking with someone.
~
   She is dressed in some loose clothes and wears a short, dark cloak.  Brown
curly hair lines her face which looks very pleasant, as if smile and joy used
to house it.  Judging by that short sword on her side, she is something else
than just a normal housewife.

the dwarf~
A taciturn dwarf is standing here, fingering his great beard.
~
   His great beard is reddish and it has been plaited carefully.  Even as a
dwarf he looks very robust, and a huge rucksack and a bunch of utilities, such
as hammers and dark chisels, seem to be carried as though they weighted
nothing.

A short, long-bearded man is standing here.
~
   What a jolly being.  His face is reddish and he looks very kind.  The
clothes he wears are of cheerfully woven and brown leather, some of them simply
patterned.  As he were ascertaining something, he utters odd words and beckons
his companier.

   These strange monsters are slimy and their skin is covered in the shaking
rings of meat and vesicles.  They have several ugly heads with an eye standing
in the each.  The land of Gwyte is where they come from.  It is rumouded that
they serve the Evil and therefore were sent around as messengers of horror.

A beautiful centaur rests on the dais.

   She is tall and well-proportioned.  The dark hair descends on the light
brown skin, making no curls.  Her big eyes radiate wisdom and pleasant heat,
making it difficult to leave this fabulous being.  No doubt she enjoys high
esteem amidst the small folk of this forest.

paved path leads toward the east.  To the northeast is a large building, 
its yard lined by an old fence of stone.

   This is a modest zone with about 65 rooms.  It is a little forest,
maybe east of Midgaard.  The area was originally written for low-level
(say 1-10) players.

move on quickly, over the damp hummocks and over the small pools of 
black disgusting water, to escape those tiny winged beasts.  Further

Before a decayed building~
   You are standing at a grass-covered yard.  Just to the west lies 
what may have been an inn of some kind years ago.  Now its roof and many 
of the other wooden parts are mostly gone, and the greyish walls break 
off so badly that you somewhat wonder how the building still stands.  An 
open doorway gives passage inside.  To the north lies an old pen.

in existence.  Rather dangerous looking stairs lead upwards.

revealing both the artistic and practical abilities of whoever was the
maker.  A thick, multicolorous carpet covers the floor.
