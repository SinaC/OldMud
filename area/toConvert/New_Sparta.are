a strange aura around him.  When you finally decide to speak, the strange
sailor points to the city and says "With technology comes power and with
power comes DANGER!!"

but at the same time oddly grotesque.  An egg-shaped dome covers
the stadium which has the ability to retract during ideal weather
conditions (rain, sleet, wind and hail).  A large electronic screen
adorns the side of the edifice, promoting today's event.

Inside The WarDome~
   The inside of the stadium offers a dramatic contrast.  Like
the exterior, the stands offer the most luxurious accommodations for
the spectators.  The field however, is a battleground composed of mud,
turf and rock surrounded by an 8-foot high stone wall.  There are two
entrances to the playing field--as audience participation is welcomed,
though not strongly recommended.
   To the east are the Blue Seats, to the north are the West Stands.
Going west, you exit the stadium.
