Temple of Sanctum~
   You stand inside a massive temple dedicated to the gods of Sanctus.  The
ceiling is supported by fluted columns and a main spiral stairwell that leads
both up and down.  Small rooms adjoin this chamber in all four cardinal
directions.  It is here mortals come to stay informed and discuss their
adventures.

The Temple of the Gods~
   You have reached the highest point in the kingdom of Sanctus.  It is from
here that the worshippers of the gods come to pay tribute to those who have
saved them from the chaos and destruction beyond the sanctuary of the city
walls.  Large windows reach from the floor to the ceiling, giving an excellent
view of the city and countryside beyond.  An altar stands in the middle of the
room with a statue on each side.

altar~
   The altar is made from black granite and has been carved into a small basin
with a high back.  Almost as if it was meant to be some sort of seat.  
Inscriptions in some foreign tongue are written on every square inch of the
altar.  You wonder what they must say and who could have written it.    
~
E
statue~
   As you examine the statues more closely you realize they must resemble the
two gods responsible for the creation and ongoing protection of Sanctus, Ferret
and Rumble.  They both radiate a strength and power that resembles the solid
white marble they were crafted from.

Inner Sanctum~
   You have reached the highest room in the tower of Sanctum where only those
devoted to the guild of Clerics are allowed to practice their skills and spells
to become masters of their discipline.  The walls are covered in a white see-
through cloth giving you the impression of being inside of a tent rather than
in a room.  The room glows brightly, though you cannot tell from what source.

High Council Meeting Room~
   This is the meeting room for the guild of clerics.  All orders and affairs
are resolved in this room by the High Council of Clerics.  They are responsible
for the health of all the citizens of Sanctus and are obligated to aid anyone who
is in need.  A large rectangular table with thirteen chairs surrounding it
fills the center of the room.  A large pane window overhead admits a glowing
aura that fills the room with serenity.

Inner Void~
   This room is exempt from all normal laws of reality.  You have entered the
realm of magic where the laws of science no longer exist.  The void you find
yourself in is created within your mind and is the perfect place to practice
your mystical arts.  For those who have trained hard enough they shall receive
assistance in their pursuit of knowledge and power.  Others will find peace in
this void and never be able to return.

Meeting Room of the Magi~
   Those who have achieved the power and fame to be considered a Magi rule the
Mages Quarter of Sanctus.  They are responsible for the upkeep of the magical
barrier that protects the city from the chaos of the outside world.  They may
also be called upon to protect the city in case of an attack.  The Magi are the
most reverred of all the classes as they are the most powerful.  But that power
has a price.  Only five Magi have survived.  Five decorative cushions are
placed in a circle in the middle of the room.

   Each cushion is of a different color.  Red, Blue, Green, Black, Yellow.  
You notice two other cushions lined against the wall before a small altar.  
They are Grey and Purple.  Those colors symbolize the stages in the raising of
a Magi.  Few every achieve that honor.  None have for the Order of the Purple
or Grey Robe.

Above the Northern Gate~
   In between the Thieves and Warriors Quarter the Northern Gate is the main
defensive hold in case of an attack.  At this distance you can just barely make
out the shimmering dome that was created by the gods and is now sustained by
the Magi.  The dome curves along the walls of the city and can not be seen for
more than a few feet in any direction.  It reminds you of looking at a mirage.
You can only see it if you glance to one side, it disappears as soon as you try
to look straight at it.  Stone stairs lead down into the city wall.

dome barrier shimmering~
   Created by Rumble and Ferret, the dome holds back the magical chaos that was
created by Drakkar.  The dome is used to keep balance within the city limits
and allows everyone to exist in peace.  Those brave enough to venture beyond
the dome do so at their own risk.  Beyond the dome the scale of balance has
collapsed and the laws of science and nature are in disorder.

Training Room~
   Pads of cloth line the walls and floor softening warriors falls as they are
thrown about by their trainers.  This is where fighters come to hone their
battling skills.  Racks of weapons line two of the four walls.  The room is
filled with a smoky haze from four brass lanterns suspended from the ceiling.
The room smells of sweat and blood.

War Room~
   A large hearthstone fireplace blazes in one wall.  Maps, charts and other
strategic planning tools are placed on a large glass table with a map of the
realm encased within.  This is where the War Master plans how to protect the
city in case of an attack.  The room is a mess with maps piled high and
scattered haphazardly wherever there is room.  This is where the defense of the
city is run from.

   The table is made out of cherry.  It is worn from years of use.  The glass
top allows for an excellent view of the map protected within.

map~
   The map is a geographic representation of Sanctus.  Not even really a map,
more of a scaled model.  The walls and buildings of the city are raised higher
than the rest of the map to give it a third dimension.  Small soldiers are
scattered around the top of the table to help the War Master place his men.

#109
Thieves Retreat~
   All the curtains are pulled tight, the shades drawn low.  A feeling of
mystery and secrecy blankets the room.  Dim lights cause a dancing of shadows
that plays tricks on the eyes.  A few of the shadows may actually be people,
hidden easily in the darkness Those who have chosen the discipline of thievery
can learn invaluable skills here to further their training and wealth.

Scheming Room~
   The masters of the underground gather here to devise their plans for the
running of Sanctus.  Their abilities in deception allowed them to take over the
internal affairs of the city.  They control the trade and finances of the city.
Many disagree with this concept but none can disagree with the results.  
Thieves are masters when it comes to politics.

Northwest Corner of the Inner Wall~
   To the north you hear the clang and crash of the smithies in the Warriors
Quarter.  To the west you see the barracks and the gate to the outside.  The
Temple of Sanctus rises above you to the southeast.  It's single spire reaching
up into the sky higher than any other building in the realm.  A stone stairwell
leads down to the inner city.

structures in Sanctus, excluding of course the temple.  Many travellers go
there to relax and unwind.  Several small houses are to the south along this
road while the northern half seems to consist mostly of shops.

   Several soldiers rush past in a hurry to make their watch in time.  You can
hear someone working a grindstone to the north, most likely the weaponsmith.  
A small house to the south is shadowed by the tower of Sanctus in the middle of
the city.

wetstone in the Warriors Quarter.  To the east the Thieves Quarter is covered
in shadows and mystery.  Not a single sound escapes from that section of the
city.  You are standing on the North Way which runs from the North Gate down to
the Temple of Sanctus.

Thieves Avenue~
   You stand in the beginning of the thieves quarter where the less honorable
class has formed a base of operations.  The thieves of the city are responsible
for the economic policies of the city and do a very good job.  Of course they
are so worried about keeping one another from stealing from the city that they
don't dare do it themselves.

   You work your way through boxes and crates of supplies.  Small corridors
lead between them, making a small maze within the building.  Looks very easy to
get disoreientated and lost.  This is where the city keeps the majority of it's
supplies.  Kind of an oxymoron that the thieves of the city handle the
finances.
