   The waves ripple softly, splashing against the side of your boat.  It rocks
gently, threatening to put you to sleep.  You feel very relaxed here.

Sea of Souls~
   You continue sailing through the chopping waters.  In the distance to the
south you can see an island filled with trees.  The shore is not to far off to
the southeast.

Forest Island~
   The ground at your feet begins to get mushy, making it hard for you to walk.
It almost feels as if you're in quicksand.  The grass is much shorter here,
showing you the sea to the north and south.

Private Island~
   A beautiful brick house stands before you.  By the looks, it hasn't been
here very long.  There doesn't appear to be anyone home.  Maybe you should
leave before someone sees you.

Private Island~
   You seem to have stepped onto an island that is owned by someone.  You can
see a small house to the north.  It's constructed of bricks and is by far the
most beautiful house you have ever seen!

Sea of Souls~
   The water seems to calm down some, allowing you to let go of the boat.  To
the north you can see an island.  It doesn't appear to be very big, but it
might be a good place to stop and rest.

Sea of Souls~
   Your boat gently begins to rock back and forth.  You feel a slight wind pick
up, causing the sea to become wavy.  You grab on to the sides of the boat,
trying to hang on.

Sea of Souls~
   As you set sail and begin drifting into the depths of the sea, you spot a
small island off to the west.  It looks nice enough, but looks can be
deceiving.

Shore~
   As you stand on the shore, you look out the the beautiful sea before you.  
What mysteries could it hold?  Would you survive a journey across it?  You hear
some birds chirping in the distance.
