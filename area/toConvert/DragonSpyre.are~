of.  Its body easily stretching 300 feet from nose to tail.  This entire
cavern, which seems to span the distance of about three levels of this
mountain, is completely filled by the dragon.  At the time it seems peaceful,
but you can tell that attacking it would be the dumbest, and last thing you
ever did.

An Ancient Path through the dense forest~
   This path appears to be very old, and well travelled.  It amazes you that
you have never noticed it was here before.  That is until you look back and
realize that the clay road is completely invisible to you from here.  To the
east, the path continues.  It appears that the western opening you entered
through is now impassible.  You are here whether you like it or not....

An Ancient Path through the dense forest~
   The path is becoming more and more difficult to traverse now, as the trees
seem to reach out to strangle you.  You feel like you are utterly alone, and,
if not for the mountain you can now see in the distance, would probably just
recall to Midgaard.  But then again, who ever said that adventuring was easy?

The End of the Ancient Path~
   You finally burst free from the grasp of the wood, only to find yourself at
the foot of a path.  The path leads north, to the mountain which has, until now
been your only beacon.  Now that you can better see the ominous mountain
looming before you, you begin to rethink the idea of recalling to Midgaard.

some unknown reason, named DragonSpyre.

deep stench of dragon is wafting through the air now, and you are starting to
feel the first tinges of dragon fear stir within you.  Maybe you should go back
while you still have that option.

almost strong enough to disable you.  The only way you are able to stand it is
by ripping of a piece of cloth, and covering your mouth and nose with it as you
walk.  Far above you, you see what must be the entrance to the cave.

   Now that you have something to somthing to concentrate upon, scaling the
mountain, you are actually able to think more clearly.  You have encountered
dragons before, and vanquished them, why should these be any different.  This
thought continues rolling through your mind, but as you reach the next level of
the cliff, it does little to ease your fear.

The first thing you are aware of is that the mountain itself seems to breathe.
In and out goes its breath, constantly in and out.  You suddenly hear footsteps
approaching from all around you, and brace for combat.  It takes you a few
moments to realize that the sound was your heart beating.

   Once inside the cave you feel completely lost to the outside world.  All
around you are horrific sounds of death and fear.  The walls are all stained
with many differing shades of red or brown, with a few frost particles
glittering on one of the walls.  Even with the cloth, the smell of the dragons
is almost unbearable.

   Within the realm of the DragonSpyres, everything seems different.  The walls
appear to reach out towards you, while the floor and ceiling struggle to crush
the life from you.  The further you proceed into the Mountain, the more you
wish you hadn't come here in the first place.

Walking through DragonSpyre~
   You are beginning to feel very unnerved.  Since you have been walking
through DragonSpyre, the screams had been slowly dying off, and now they are no
more.  Normally the lack of death cries would be a welcome change, only now
they have been replaced by a very eerie silence.  You don't like this one bit.

   This cave is really starting to get on your nerves.  With each new step, you
hear what sounds like giggling coming from all sides, goading you onward.  
Daring you to learn the secrets that DragonSpyre has held for the past three
hundred years.  "They are only dragons.  "

   You have reached a fork in the path through DragonSpyre.  You can't be sure
which way you should go, but the odd scraching sound to the east makes you want
to go west.  The giggling that has been following you around has now become a
full blown laugh.  "They are ONLY dragons.  "

   You have managed, through luck(?  ), to find the lair of the white dragon.
It stands before you, glaring at you with its pale blue eyes.  All around, the
walls are coated with a thick layer of ice.  You slip several times before
gaining your balance enough to face the fearsome beast.  Will you fight it, or
flee?  "It is JUST a dragon.  "

Walking through DragonSpyre~
   The hallway here is a radical change from where you just where.  Here, the
walls look much more undeveloped than the last hallway you were in.  It feels
like time itself is slowing down.  The hallway looks like it goes on for all
eternity, but at the sluggish pace you are moving, eternity might not be that
long of a distance.

Lair of the Copper Dragon~
   Within the bounds of this room, time has seemed to stop.  There is no
movement, save for the large mass at the back of the room.  Out of the corner
of you eye, you manage to catch a glimpse of a droplet of water "falling" from
a stalagtite...  It appears to have been in the same position for the past
century.  You have no chance to move before the Dragon strikes.

Treasure Room~
   All about you are the untold fortunes of many generations of families.  
Nothing here seems to be touched by age, it is all in perfect condition.  It
has remained as it was many years ago when it was taken.  Although the Dragon
and the original families considered these items "treasure", you manage to find
little of value beside a pile of gold coins you collect.
