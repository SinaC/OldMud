Entering the Village~
   All at once the darkness and thick foliage give way to a large, grubby
village.  Looking around, you see that most of the inhabitants of this place
must have little or no money.  Dogs with only three legs, chickens clucking to
and fro, all of it just seems so...  Well, poor and grubby.  You only have a
short time to register these facts, though, as you are suddenly surrounded by a
group of heavily armed men and taken to a holding cell.  Holding Cell You sit in
a stinky, dirt floored holding cell, with no idea why you have been put here.  
Obviously this village is under some sort of militaristic control, and visitors
are unwelcome.  The only thing to keep you occupied is the fact that the small
hole in the ground used for a toilet stinks so bad that you have to keep trying
to hold your breath, and every time you take in air you have to cover your mouth
with your arm and breath that way or else you'll gag.

   *Mordecai's Village
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova
Mordecai is a pagan worshipper of a God that does not exist.  He possesses
an extreme charisma, though, and has gathered together a large following
where he has established his own village, or more aptly put - cult.
His main goal is money, so he has stolen the Lord's daughter, Penelope (see
Lord's Keep, also available for download) in order to ransom her off.
The entrance into this zone is made to be a trap - the original intent was
to have a spec_proc on a room that would teleport a player every few ticks
into the Holding Cell, a message displayed to the player that they were
captured by Mordecai's guards.  In the cell is a hole that does not show up
in the room descrip, but is there and the key is there to the door.
Midlevel mobs and eq, with a bit of fun in the descrips.  Enjoy.
 * note: Some of the decsrips in this zone may not be to your taste.
        You might find them vulgar. That said, fair warning.

tents, and outbuildings.

   This is the end of a path which leads to the camp prisoner's holding cells,
one of which is directly west of you, currently closed.  To the southwest, right
next to the cell, is what appears to be an outhouse.  To the northwest is
another holding cell.

   You stand at the end of a dirt path, or as Mordecai would have it, one of the
'roads' in the village.  A crude bamboo holding cell is directly west of you,
with an outhouse just north of it.  To the south are more cells.

A Holding Cell~
   Much like your own, this cell offers no comfort whatsoever.  In fact, this
cell is MUCH more uncomfortable than yours was.  Sitting close enough for you to
reach through the bars and touch it is an outhouse.  Actually, all you know for
sure is that it is a small square building that smells like something out of a
cheap 'B' horror movie.  Just the same, you assume it's an outhouse.  Another
clue to the small building's capacity is the tepid trail, a mini stream, of
urine which runs downhill right through the middle of this cell - EWWWWWW!

An Outhouse~
   This small space smells worse than a huge stable holding four hundred head of
cattle who haven't been outside for three months.  This place smells BAD.  Two
holes dug in opposing corners offer incense to remember, your feet squish into
the wet dirt floor, and although you consider yourself a relatively strong
person, you find your gorge rising, and your inability to suppress it only
validates the fact that this place REALLY STINKS.

An Outhouse~
   This outhouse, smelly by anyone's standards, but not that bad by outhouse
standards, is a small 8x8 cubicle which allows relief to most of the village.  
Although it IS the public poop hole, it is relatively kept up and, against your
better judgement, you find yourself wanting to try it out - just for the heck of
it.

looking in that direction, you see why.  To the north is a barn, while to the
south is a huge tent set up on a hill.

   This tent, roughly 10x10, serves as the primary dwelling for one of the
families under Mordecai's 'care'.  Four cots sit side by side along one wall and
a leather chest sits in a corner, holding what you assume would be all of their
wordly belongings.

A Dusty Trail~
   The trail leads north and south from here.  North you see what appear the
main buildings for this village, possibly even Mordecai's place of dwelling.  
South of you are the many huts and tents which serve as homes for Mordecai's
people.

A Dusty Trail~
   Here you stand at the top of a large sloping hill, which slopes downward to
the east.  It appears as if a temple or place of worship has been erected there,
you may enter it to the east.  North of you are the main buildings for Mordecai,
south are the many huts and tents of the village people.

The End of the Road~
   Directly north of you looms Mordecai's home, a tall stone structure with a
sloping peaked roof.  It appears that he fears none of his people, for the door
to his home is wide open.  To the east you see another stone house, this one a
bit smaller than Mordecai's, and west of you is yet another stone house.

Outdoor Temple~
   This small basin, set in an almost tranquil setting, has been fashioned into
a place of worship by the people of the village.  Wooden benches serving as
pughs have been set into side of the hill.  At the bottom of the basin, a stage
with a podium has been erected, obviously for Mordecai and his sermons.

Lieutenant Caspan's Home~
   Lieutenant Caspan, Mordecai's most trusted advisor and soldier, has been
granted this home in recognition of his extreme loyalty, and he does appear at
all pleased to see that you have invaded his sanctuary.

The Wives~
   The interior of this home smells of both stale perfume and rotten fish.  
Mordecai keeps his favorites for the month in this home, in apparent 'luxury',
treating them well for the services they render.  Heaps of stained bedding lie
in disarray all over the floor.  Pillows, torn and in some places, bloodstained,
lie in heaped in different corners.

Mordecai's Home~
   This is the home of the Great Mordecai?  One cot, one wash basin (dry and
apparently unused for the most part), and a wardrobe on the east wall are all
that occupy this place.  One would think a man of Mordecai's stature would have
just a bit more in the way of luxuries.

   You have finally figured out why Mordecai didn't have any good stuff in his
home.  It was all here.  A plush, velvet upholstered chair sits in the center of
his wealth, obviously the place where Mordecai enjoys a great deal of his time.
