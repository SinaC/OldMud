Keep in hopes of finding treasure or something that we can live off of for a

have copied them into this journal so that I may study them further.  I believe
they are some kind of spell that will transport me to another place in this

Plot         : This will be the Keep of Grand Duke Kalithorn (it can be renamed
   to fit into the mud..it was just something I came up with) a mercenary 
   turned politician/good guy after his wife was kidnapped by bandits. The Duke 
   swore that he would not rest until his wife was found and the bandits 

   punished.so he is 'haunting' (for lack of a better word) the Keep.
Links        : 60s, 01w
Notes        : Within a forest or perhaps a little set back from a main road.
   Neutral to slightly evil. Most of the mobs would be rats, bats and sprites 
   which would be the evil aligned mobs. Kalithorn and his undead guards and
   sentinels would be of neutral align. LOOK ZEDIT

enormous crack runs diagonally from the top left corner downwards to the bottom
right corner, strangely doubling every image.  Along the gaudy golden frame
there are many, many cracks and dents and the bottom left forner of the mirror
has been broken off.  The wall paper had long ago cracked and peeled off the
western wall, but the eastern wall still holds a small wooden shelf with a few
cobweb covered books.

   This design is a complicated pattern of silver and wrought iron.  Curiously
though it doesn't seem as rusted or faded as the rest of the Keep.

Eastern Wing~
   This hallway is clogged with dust and debris.  Torn paintings and broken
pottery are strewn across the once beautiful hardwood floors and the thick
striped wallpaper is peeling in great rends from the walls themselves.  Doors
line this hallway and a faint light shines beneath the eastern most door.

with strange symbols and bears a giagantic replica of the Grand Duke's coat of
arms.  Large barrels lay stacked neatly next to the huge door and the rest of
the floor is riddled with pockmarks and rat droppings.

Caverns Beneath the Keep~
   A long twisting pathway runs off into the darkness.  The scent of water

looking slime.  The caverns seem to extend deep into the earth beneath the Keep

cavern.

   This cavern opens into a circular room with a cathedral ceiling.  The rock
walls are smooth and covered with tapestries at random intervals.  Some bear
scenes of battles, castles and another on the far east wall bears the likeness
of Grand Duke Kalithorn himself!  A gently cascading waterfall is the source of
the rushing noise that echoes through the other caverns.  It gently pours from
the southern wall and the small pool reaches the midpoint of this room.

gate is barely visible.  The wrought iron railing prevents its occupants from
