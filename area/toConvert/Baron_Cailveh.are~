cailveh baron~
the Baron Cailveh~
The Baron lounges in his favorite chair, reading from a thick book.
~
   He is a short, stocky man who looks as if he might need a bit of shaping up
to be called 'in shape'.  His eyes are a bit hollowed, as are most men's eyes
spent too long reading from books.  His hair is all but vanished except for two
thin lines on the sides of his head.

Wooden Guard Gate~
   The road south of this gate is covered in an even coating of gravel, just a
short distance to the southeast a small settlement is visible.  The gate appears
to be more of a stopping point for travelers to stop for directions or to make
certain that the Baron is indeed in his tower rather than a checkpoint for a
military operation - although there are guards who man it.  To the west is the
short stretch of the King's Highway before it turns north, headind far from
Cailveh's lands.

main export is corn, wheat and healing potions. There is a short road
that passes a small settlement of the Baron's people and the Tower of
the Baron itself.
A great deal of excellent eq is included in this zone as well as some
extremely difficult mobs.

To the east the road runs directly up to Cailveh's front door, to the north the

Stone and Mortar Hallway~
   The stairs open into a hallway that is neither large nor small, simply very
average.  The walls are of stone and mortar, well formed and solid to the touch.
On the south wall is a door, the stairs lead downward to the main floor of the
tower and the hallway runs westward toward more doors, actually ending at a
door.

End of the Hall~
   A wide door lies on the west wall of the hall which would be the dead end to
the hall if there weren't a door there.  Off to the east are more doors, with a
stairway leading downward at the end of the hall.

Gilzaan's Private Chambers~
   Gilzaan, being the eldest of Cailveh's two sons and most likely to receive
the endowment of all that Cailveh holds upon his death, holds the largest room
in the tower save for Cailveh himself.  All that is holy and worthy, studious
and pious lies in an orderly fashion in this enormous apartment.  A door lies in
the south wall.

Necromocis' Private Chambers~
   Necromocis is Cailveh's youngest son, but certainly the brighter of the two.
Most of Necromocis' time is spent up in the higher reaches of the tower, pouring
over the ancient tomes which Cailveh holds locked within his library.  
Necromocis could soak up knowledge all day long and still yearn for more at the
fall of night.  He is Cailveh's pride and joy, unencumbered the knowledge that
he may have to one day run the Barony, as his brother is.

Sitting Room~
   This room is dominated by a huge fireplace on the west wall.  It spans the
entire length of the wall, the stonework giving the room a very rustic, cozy
feel.  Lounge chairs and couches lie in a fashionable array about the room.  
This is where Cailveh and his family spend most of their evenings together, away
from the main court life which never seems to end downstairs.

fireplace~
   It is a huge piece of work, spanning the entire length of the room.  The
place where the firewood is actually kept and burnt only takes up about a
quarter of the space that it could, the rest of it is just ornate.  Most of the
rocks are made from regular, grayish stone but there is a particular run of them
that are a bit darker than the rest.

Cailveh's Private Chambers~
   This section of the room is more an entryway into the larger part of
Cailveh's private area which is shared with his wife.  The room follows the
curve of the tower, opening east into the private chambers and north into the
sitting room.

Cailveh's Private Chambers~
   This lavish section of Cailveh's private quarters are reserved for he and his
wife only, a retreat for the two of them to get away from everything completely.
There is a large bed and a long, low divan that sits before a fireplace - a very
appealing setup.

Bathing Area~
   A carved bathing vessel lies in the center of the room, raised upon a
curious-looking stone pedestal designed specifically for holding the hot embers
of coal that heat the tub above it.  A curtain can be drawn about the tub or
left wide open, a wooden desk lies against the west wall with a washbasin and
mirror atop it.

Runed Stairwell~
   The runes on the sides of this stairwell or there as wards against intruders,
but more so they are wards of notification which will let Cailveh when an
unwelcome guest has intruded upon his private demenses unwelcome.  Enter upward
into the private work area of the Baron Cailveh, but beware of his fury and the
wrath of his gods.

Laboratory~
   The entire room in this area and to the east is covered in tables and runes,
the walls lined with shelving which holds all manner of scrolls, books and
tablature.  The wooden creaks underfoot as you move about, even a shifting of
your weight makes a fair amount of noise.  It will be very difficult, indeed, to
stay here undetected for very long.

Study~
   This is a more sedate setting than that just north of here.  A plush chair
lies against the west wall, one that looks very much like it is used extremely
often.  Shelves line the east wall, however the books there are more scholarly
than for research.

Library~
   If it seemed that there were a lot of books on the shelves in the rooms to
the north, then you had no idea what to expect here.  Every single foot of space
available has been utilized for shelving for books, all of them organized by
size and content.

   There is wide, tall window in the southeastern wall, one that rises all the
way to the ceiling and opens out into the heavens.  A strange object has been
placed near to the window, one that looks much like a long tube with glass at

Artifact Room~
   This room has been looted.  Nothing remains except empty shelves and tables
that were once laden with numerous items and artifacts.  The patches of dust
free shelves hint at the outlines of the previous occupants.  Uneven shadings of
the walls hint at portraits that may have once been hung for many years.
