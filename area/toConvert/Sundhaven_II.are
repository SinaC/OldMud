   You stand amidst a tumble of rocks of various sizes and shades of grey and

impossible to continue downwards without meeting an untimely (?  ) death.  A
few homes have been hidden here in the cliff face, a bit of a hike from any
civilization.

credits info~
   Sundhaven is designed to be a newbie starting town, essentially
an alternative to a time-worn Midgaard. It is complete with the guilds
of the four basic classes, shops, bank, post office, and several
connecting points which make it easy to link to any world.  
SPECS:
guilds:  {CLASS_WARRIOR, 6757, SCMD_WEST},
         {CLASS_THIEF, 6740, SCMD_EAST},
         {CLASS_MAGIC_USER, 6616, SCMD_UP},
         {CLASS_CLERIC, 6661, SCMD_WEST},
   Room 6602 may function as a donation room if you desire.
Room 6601 may serve as a player loadroom, with the following
equipment loading with new players:
      objs 6602, 6603, 6604 to all.
      obj 6605 to thieves  (dagger).
      obj 6606 to mages  (staff).
      obj 6607 to clerics  (mace).
      obj 6608 to warriors  (short sword).
   I hope you find the zone useful.

An untravelled path~
   A thin line of soil barely resembling a path threads its lonesome way
between the dull grey stones.  You can only wonder if there is much of note out
this direction, as a sense of barrenness is prominent.

Climbing a small bluff~
   A few gnarled, wind-tortured trees spread their meager limbs in hunched
eastward arcs.  There is little that is extraordinary about this place.  It is
deserted, it is lonely, yet a particularly green bluff forms a plateau just
above you.  It calls to you in an eerie way, yet emits a chaotic aura that
might be best left alone.

Blind Man's Bluff~
   The lonely hilltop is blanketed in a strange, rich green grass-cover, and
the only sound is that of the wind whistling over the moors.  A haunting,
otherworldly presence has made this bluff its home, casting what malevolence it
yet can on the mortal world, and giving the bluff its name.

   The stone-rimmed path opens out to a clearing of dirt, encircled by broad
oaks and maples with leaves the color of honey.  To the north a black gate is
closed against the clamor of the world, and the road continues east to town,
and west where it vanishes into a fog banked forest.

Some images have been carved and charred in by a fiery touch, a sternly
beautiful woman with a ruby dagger sheathed at her waist stands beside a man
with the robe of the priesthood.  The cold wind of the sea blows the sails of
the rocking ship they ride upon.  The rogue woman is imploring a second man to
destroy a beast far too great for his strength, a cruel smile playing upon her
lips.  The image is frozen upon the bark, immobile, yet it is apparent she is
winning the battle.  Beneath the picture are engraved the words "Know thy

the blood and risk of their everyday existence, it is nevertheless a haven in
which bounties can be split and repose taken by a warm fireplace hung with
guild daggers, skillfully tapered and too hot from the flames to steal.  A bar
sunken into the far stone wall assists your dexterity..  So it is said..  And
bunks are layer the area to the east, hung with stolen tapestries and sheets.

everything seems to indicate to you that this is not the sort of fun fairy-tale
niche your mother liked to tell tales about by the fireside of your ancient
home.  Do you continue, or turn back?  Sometimes shadows may form a bluff of
great danger in the recesses of your imagination.

A dark corridor~
   The hallway bends sharply, leading off to the south and west.  No light
penetrates either one, so as always the question of where you want to go
depends on where you've been.

A dark corridor~
   The corridor halts abruptly.  A drop opens out at your feet, beneath which
water shivers and shimmers, black against black.  The pool is nearly still,
only an occasional ripple moving across the surface gives any indication of
life, or life in death, within.  Northwards the hall disappears into the dark.

Edge of a black-bottom pool~
   You wade ankle-deep into the murky waters of a black-bottom pool.  It
appears this pool was once a nice pleasure bath for the priests and their
guests, but has fallen into decay from recent lack of use.  Who knows what
creatures make their home beneath the dark surface.

A black-bottom pool~
   Swamp-like waters black as coal enclose you and wash like cold slime over
every limb, each movement sending a chill coursing through from ears to toes.
The smooth, dark bottom of the pool shows traces of faded ornamental designs,
now mostly hidden and eroded with moss and algae.  Few can pin a name on the
grotesque underwater creatures that now make this their home.

The cartographers~
   You are in a closely walled-in room with little air and much light; a
glass-fronted bookcase displays a variety of map parchments, though as they are
curled and bound with colored ribbon, it is difficult to discern their
contents.

The corner store~
   You enter a small, wooden-planked shop, in sore need of some repairs, but
essentially kept very tidy by someone with little else to do but revel in her
senility.  A few crowded shelves hold items that may be of use to you in
everyday living.

A cobblestone road~
   You stand outside the southern gate of the town of Sundhaven.  The walls are
high enough to keep the town secure, and ringed with tendrils of lush green
ivy.  The busy murmur of citylife can be heard from beyond.  Southwards, the
cobblestone road crosses a meadow of sorts before disappearing into a line of
dark woods.

A crawlspace~
   You slip into someone's private domain.  Better leave without a trace before
long, it could be dangerous to remain, should the dweller of this place return
and claim what is theirs.
