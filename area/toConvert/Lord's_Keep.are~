Lord's Keep Zone Description Room by Kaan~
   *Lord's Keep *Written by Kaan for Dibrova This is the ancestral home of the
Lord of Jareth, who has governed the City of Freedom since the days when Jareth
was but a vision in the first Lord's head.  Since then, a new Lord has always
ascended to the position which keeps Jareth profitable and free, in Lord's Keep.
This zone has a small quest written into it - the Lord's daughter, Penelope was
abducted by Mordecai (another zone available) and now the Lord weeps in mourning
for his beloved daughter.  Save the daughter from Mordecai and bring her back in
one piece to her father, get a large pile of gold.  There is some mid- to
upper-level eq and mobs here, as well as some fun areas to explore.  This zone
is meant to connect to Jareth.

tell tale of the smith/mage Gabadiel's masterwork: a sword of unequalled power,
and two swords that came before, discarded as 'Not quite what I was working
towards'.  Looking around, you notice a distinct lack of any swords.  You think

with a walk way made from red wood chips showing the way through the trees.  
The path leads north, south and east, or you may enter the Keep to the west.

The Beginning of a Very Dark & Uncomfortable Passageway~
   You have entered a very cramped earthen passageway which is darker than
darkest night.  You feel something skitter by you feet and give a small shudder
at the thought of what it might be.  The walls seem to have been man made, dug
out of hard clay, without supports.  You begin to feel a chill, and even a bit
damp, although the walls themselves are not wet or even clammy, just cold.  The
tunnel heads east into darkness or you may climb back out into the gazebo.

the southwest is beautiful rolling hills.  Looking down on the courtyard, you
see guards on break, sweethearts strolling hand in hand, and common folk out
enjoying the sunshine.

courtyard and much of the land south and east of the Keep's walls.  You can exit
south onto the balcony, or leave to the east into the bedroom.

   This small lounge was made for the express purpose of allowing those entering
the Lord's presence to tidy themselves up a bit before presenting themselves to
him.  A long mirror adorns the north wall, a small basin filled with water
stands next to it, and a dust brush sits on a shelf next to the mirror.  Lounge
chairs are resting along the south wall, although from the grooves worn in the
wood from centuries of nervous pacing, most people who enter this room don't use
the chairs very often.  Doors are to the east and west.

hang everywhere overhead, fireplaces abound, and servants scurry to and fro in a
seemingly mad and mindless frenzy.  A long table off to the side seats servants
who are on their break, but currently there are none there.

a comfortable chair sitting before a servicable desk.  Several couches sit along
the walls along with luxurious chairs.  A fireplace crackles warmly in the
eastern wall directly behind the Lord's desk.  A small door in the south wall
sits closed at present.  Pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of this office,
you feel that the Lord must be a kind and just man and deserves the priviledges
his title offers.  A door to the west allows exit.

Lord's Gardens~
   This may very well be the most beautiful peace of land you ever have set foot
upon.  Vibrant colors surround you, lending you a feeling of serenity and bliss.
Knowing that such wonders can exist in nature lends you the realization that
although at many times the world appears to be flawed, there is a balance of
perfection that gives those flaws their very reason for existance.  A winding
stone path wends it's way through the garden, heading north and west, and a door
to your south allows entrance back into the keep.

   This room, austere almost to the point of being monkish, boasts only the
necessities for sleeping.  A bed, although large, sits in the center of the room
looking as if its use is as minimal as its style.  The only other furnishings in
the room are a dresser, a small wardrobe, and, curiously, a portrait delicately
painted in soft hues of the Keep, sitting high upon Lord's Hill, proudly flying
the standard for Jareth.  A closed door blocks the entrance to the south and an
archway leading into the Lord's private dining room leads west, or you may exit
the Lord's Suite to your north.

powerful presence, but you also can't help but feel that something must be wrong
here.  The guards standing at attention here are afraid to even look in any
direction but straight ahead and from inside the castle you hear no sounds of
merriment or laughter, as is usually the case in the entryway of the Lord's
Keep.  The Lord's Court lies west of you, while the twin guard towers flank your

Southeast Guard Tower~
   This guard tower looks as if it may have seen some action in times past.  
Small chunks of stone are missing around the arrow slits, and many nicks and
chunks are missing from the walls themselves.

Southwestern Guard Tower~
   This looks more like a break room than a guard tower.  A stack of old books
are piled in one corner, and the remains of someone's lunch sits in another.  
The parapet continues to the east and to the north from here.
