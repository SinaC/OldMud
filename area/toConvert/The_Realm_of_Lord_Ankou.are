Edge of the Walkway~
   You have skirted your way right to edge of the path and are now able to get a
good look at what lies below.  Way below.  The 'path' that you thought might
lead down in a zig zag or perhaps in steps is actually a set of stone rungs
notched into the cliff face.  The forest, so far below where you stand looking
down upon it, seems strangely dark, strangely forbidding and very far away.  
Maybe it would just be best to forget climbing this ledge.  After all, isn't
Thursday?  Seems like Grainy's in Jareth had a really good dinner special on
Thursdays...  Yeah, that's it.

credits info~
   *The Realm of Lord Ankou
*Written by Kaan for Dibrova
This is a forest zone surrounded on all four sides by an unscalable cliff
face.  It is meant to hold four zones
Banshide, the Haunted House, the
Castle of the Vampyre, and the Witch's Hollow.  All but the Witch's Hollow
are available for download, as the Hollow is not yet complete.
This is an extremely high level zone, meant for 40-50groups, the mobs are
often aggro, Lord Ankou himself drives a band of spectral minions before his
cart which he rides throught the forest, so players not only have to contend
with Ankou as the highest level mob, but also his minions who will fight
for their Lord to the death.  The code for the minions to follow Ankou
can be found on the snippets page.
This was originally intended to connect to the farmlands, at their western-
most side at the chasm.  The farmlands are also available for download.  The
lack of a way out of this zone is intentional, just a little thing to get
players stark raving mad when visiting here if they forget to bring a recall.

Climbing down the Cliff~
   Standing so near to the top of the walkway, hanging on for dear life, you
realize what a follhearty decision this was to climb this rocky face.  You can
see birds playing below you, almost DIRECTLY below you in the treetops of the
forest so far beneath your feet.  One wrong step, one slip of the hand on the
tenuous handhold you already maintain, and you are birdfeed in the treetops.  
Maybe you should just climb up one more step, get off this walkway and call it
all good.

Climbing down the Cliff~
   This climb is going to take forever!  You are still not even halfway down the
cliff and it seems like the closer to the forest you get, the darker and more
forboding it gets.  Not to mention every time you look down, a wave of nausea
racks your body, making you almost lose your grip on the rungs.

Halfway down a 'Trail'~
   Well, here you are - halfway up or down depending on how you look at it.  
Your situation has improved a little bit.  It looks like if you fell now, you
would only break a great many bones, rather than just die.  Of course, maybe
dying would be preferable.  You see that the trees below are twisted and
gnarled, all of them seeming more dead than alive.  Sure is encouraging.

Nearing the Forest Floor~
   The forest looms ever closer, ever more dark and sinister.  You can now see
that the birds you saw from up above playing in the treetops were actually
buzzards which seem to constantly circle the treetops everywhere, fighting each
other and anything that trys to get past them.  Looking up, you realize that the
climb ahead would be a real bitch, maybe even impossible.

Tree Top Level - Almost to the Ground~
   The trees that you have begun to descend through seem to try to grab your
feet as you climb down the cliff.  The branches all snag your clothing, sharp
and piercing as you climb down.  The buzzards won't seem to leave you alone and
fighting here is just not what you had in mind when you began your descent.  
The forest floor below you, all covered in shadows and mystery, is just a long
jump down, but still a far enough jump that a broken leg or ankle would almost
certainly result in a jumping attempt.

Dark and Sinister Forest~
   The forest around you seems dead, all the trees and their branches seem
withered and brittle.  Strangely enough, with all the lingering death around
you, there seems to be a great deal of movement around you, but always out of
the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.  The cliff face runs along to
your south, the forest growing right up to the edge and up the edge in some
spots.  There is a set of rungs grooved into the cliff face here.  It looks as
if you may be able to climb up!

Dark and Sinister Forest~
   The forest around you seems dead, all the trees and their branches seem
withered and brittle.  Strangely enough, with all the lingering death around
you, there seems to be a great deal of movement around you, but always out of
the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.

spots.  To the east there is some sort of break in the forest, maybe a clearing
or something, although it doesn't look like it gets any lighter...

opening in the trees, almost as if it lead to a meadow or field of some sort,
but it couldn't be, because it is still just as dark as ever in that direction.

It looks very old and very unsafe.

around you.  The house looks very old and very unsafe.  Also uninviting.

Halfway Up a 'Trail'~
   You find your arms are getting way too tired to keep up the climbing the way
you've been.  The top of the cliff still seems miles away from where you are
now, and there is no spot on this cliff to just stop and take a break.  It might
be a good idea to climb back down, and take your chances in the forest.

Climbing Up the Cliff~
   You simply cannot do it.  Your arms are like jello and your breath is coming
in hot racking gasps that make your palms sweat and your head ache.  You have no
choice but to head back down to the forest and find your way out some other way.

Dark and Sinister Forest~
   The forest around you seems dead, all the trees and their branches seem
withered and brittle.  Strangely enough, with all the lingering death around
you, there seems to be a great deal of movement around you, but always out of
the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.  To your north is a deep,
dark valley.  It looks exteremely uninviting from here, best to just pass it by.

the corner of your eye.  Always just out of sight.  To the south is a deep
hollow, many miles across and quite deep from the looks of it.  Of course, it is
hard to tell by looks since it is so dark here.

is such a presence, such a large obstacle, you feel that this valley must have
been created on purpose by some god, some higher power, to punish the
inhabitants for wrongdoings.  Or something.

have fallen off from the cliffsides and piled up at the base.  A set of small
tracks seem to come and go from beneath two large rocks.

like a valley inside this valley.

Dark Tunnel~
   As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see that you are in a tunnel hewn
out of the cliff rockbed.  A feeling in your gut tells you that this tunnel was
not made by ordinary creatures.  Little tracks lead to and from a crude nest
near the tunnel entrance.  A sudden movement catches your eye and you see the
fleeing form of some small creature dashing outside through the rockfall.  You
can explore the tunnel more to the north or head back outside.

Dark Tunnel~
   A think layer of dust covers the hewn floor.  The undisturbed state of things
in the tunnel show that no one has passed through this way in ages.  The stone
walls become more polished and smoother as one progresses northwards.  A faint
odor of incense and spices lingers in the air.

Dark Chamber~
   The tunnel opens up into a small chamber.  The polished walls reflect the
torchlight in an eerie way.  The smell of incense and spices hang heavily in the
air, stiffling you.  A stone slab sits in the middle of the chamber.  Strange
runes adorn the stone slab.  A faded trail of blood upon the slab catches your
eye and you follow the trail to the floor.  There you see that you are standing
in the middle of a pentagram inscribed into the stone floor.  Repressing a
feeling of dread, you get on your knees to study a small indentation in the
middle of the pentagram....

Entrance to another Dimension~
   - The walls of the chamber begin to shimmer brightly.  The outline of the
pentagram catches fire and burns brightly.  The runes on the slab begin to glow
fiercely.  A droning sound begins and intensifies painfully.  Reality seems to
slip away as the room begins to spin around you.  Trying to get a grip on
yourself in this maddening scene, you notice an entryway opening up before you.
