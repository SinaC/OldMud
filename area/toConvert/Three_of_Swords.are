seemingly to show great intelligence.  Her mouth twitches into a sneer...

feet toe to head, and weighs a good three hundred pounds -- mostly on his biceps
and pectorals it appears.  An ornate scabbard slaps by his side, with the pommel
of a silvered dagger sticking out...  A tiny weapon for such a large man!

A Scraggly Trail~
   This trail slopes up and away from the main road to 
the west.  At points the trail seems to fade into 
obscurity against the grey stone and near-grey mountain 
grass prevalent here.  The trail leads generally eastward 
and up higher into the rocky ground.  There is a sign 
here, seemingly out-of-place in this rough country.

A Scraggly Trail~
   What could barely be called a trail leads west back 
down the mountainside, and down into a very small valley 
where a small house sits in the middle of a well-groomed 
yard.  The door to the house is open and inviting, 
welcoming you for a visit.

A Groomed Path~
   You are standing in the western end of a very, very 
small valley, just about room enough for the one house 
standing to your east.  You can see from here that the 
door to the cozy cottage is open and inviting, but the 
interior seems very dark.  A path bordered by shrubberies 
leads up to the structure, and ends where you are 
standing; right by the easiest path back up into the 
mountains.

   The path you are on leads from the front door of the
cottage to your east, to the edge of the small valley
to the west.  The building seems quiet...almost too
quiet.  A small voice in the back of your head, the
same voice that has saved your life on countless
occasions, seems to be telling you that something is
very, very wrong here.

   Devastation greets your eyes.
   The forge has been blasted apart, along with most of 
the back door.  Hammers, tongs, and anvils lie about in 
one gigantic mess, and the smith's bed smoulders yet.  
This place has been utterly wrecked and blasted apart, by 
more than one man you would think from all the tracks in 
the dust...

   Ha!  Lucky, you were always lucky!  Under the pillow is a half-written
letter, unaddressed.  The bits of text that aren't smudged, burnt, and smeared
tell tale of the smith/mage Gabadiel's masterwork: a sword of unequalled power,
and two swords that came before, discarded as 'Not quite what I was working
towards'.  Looking around, you notice a distinct lack of any swords.  You think
you may have a motive now...

A Small Garden~
   This garden was probably once kept orderly and weedless.
Unfortunately, it seems someone has been careless with a

ashes, and the remains of a trail leading to the east edge
of this tiny valley.

    The mountain range continues north from here, and 
widens out into a small plateau just to your south.  Going
east and west from here would be a bad idea, considering 
the steepness of the drop.  From this height, you have a 
fairly good panoramic view to the south, including what 
appears to be a small mountain village to your south and 
west, and a tall, ominous peak westwards from here.

rocky area.  To the east, south, and west are gentle 
slopes leading down into different areas of the mountains.
   A giant, dark peak looks down over you to the west, 
looking quite spooky indeed!

mountain ridge.  Surpisingly, there seems to be signs of 
traffic in this area, leading into the large depression 
here.  The going looks somewhat dangerous, and you decide 
to exercise a little caution.

   You are standing upon another mini-plateau, bordered by
a sheer wall of rock to the north.  You can climb up the 
slope to the east, or continue along the flat area to the 
west.  Another slope leads downwards to the south, looking
unsafe but climbable.

the plateau continues, and you think you can climb up the 
steep rocky slope just west of here.  You are afforded a 
good view of the lower regions of this depression, and you
think you spot what might be a cave south and down from 
here...

   This slope is fairly treacherous, but looks to be 
somewhat safer to the north.  East the slope leads down 
to a small plateau that also looks considerably safer 
than your other choices.  The shale under your feet 
slips badly, and you are almost thrown off balance; 
this is no place to be without mountaineering equipment.

   You are standing on a point outcropping with a 
beautiful view of the mountains to the north.  Far 
below, you see what appears to be a foot-path climb 
up to the central mountain, a peak that looks dark 
and disturbing.  You get very bad vibes from that 
mountain for some reason, and it doesn't seem like 
a very good idea to try to find a way to get there.
   The only safe way to leave this overlook is to 
the south.

up to a small plateau to the north from here, or carefully
head down to the floor of the depression to the west.  
You're not sure which is safer...

The Depression Floor~
   A small path leads south here, away from the rocky 
slope leading up to the east.  A small spring burbles 
here, evidently the cause of much of the traffic.  
Looking up, you see sheer rock walls surrounding much 
of the depression, making an effective fortress of
this place.

   The small path you are standing on leads north, and
east into what appears to be a large cave hollowed out
of the mountainside.  The whole place seems quiet, too
quiet in fact.  Your little adventurer's intuition is
busily warning you of traps.

A Cave Entrance~
   A cave leads into the heart of the mountainside, well-
lit by sconces upon the walls.  A large rock sits by 
the side here, near a small firepit.  Debris litters the 
area; rabbit bones, half of a broken whetstone, and random
litter.  The ground is devoid of grass, and well trodden 
by many pairs of boots.  Strange that someone should live 
so deep in the mountains...

light streams in from the west, accompanied by a slight 
breeze, making the flames in the sconces flutter a bit
and throw stange shadows upon the walls.  This passageway 
heads north and south from here, each way seeming dark and
stuffy compared to outdoors.  From the tracks in the 
floor, you guess that the north is the more used.

comfortable in this strange place.  From far off you hear

   This is as close to the peak as you're going to get, 
unless you use that tiny, tiny path leading up to your 
north.  Up the side of the mountain you see a great cave 
hollowed out, the inside pitch black.  The path leads down 
the mountains to your east, which seems to be the best 
place to go.

A Small, Dangerous Path~
   This path leads up, up, up the side of the mountain, to 
the evil-seeming cave.  It also heads down to the south--a 
lot safer place to be.  In fact, you hear footsteps above 
your head...

A Small, Dangerous Path~
   Unfortunately, you realize too late that this bigger 
ledge that leads north to the darkened cave is an ideal 
spot for an ambush.  This ledge gives you a beautiful 
panoramic view of the entire mountain range, however.  
Breathtaking!

The Cave Entrance~
   You are standing in the entrance of a simply huge cave!
The size is stunning!  All around the entrance are burnt 
bones and various types of wooden and metal debris.  Giant 
claw marks are all along the ground, leading back deeper 
into the cave.
   Two tunnels lead off from here, one up, one down.  There
are claw marks leading in either direction.

A Sloping Tunnel~
   The tunnels slopes up to the north deeper into the 
mountain.  A rather gusty breeze riffles your clothing 
from ahead somewhere.  The claw marks in the stone floor 
continue up the passage, through the darkness.

A Sloping Tunnel~
   The tunnel continues its slope upwards, and the wind 
blows at you even stronger yet.  The claw tracks in the 
stone stop abruptly here, where there seems to be a lot
of unearthed dirt and stone around, heaped upon the floor.  
You feel uneasy about this place.

   The floor up ahead looks...  Strange.  You don't think going ahead would be a
good idea.

The Pit~
   You fall through the illusionary floor.
 
   You hit the poisoned spikes below.
 
   You die very slowly of bloodloss, your head impaled at 
an awkward angle.

A Sloping Tunnel~
   This tunnel slopes deep, down into the mountain's heart.
The air feels still and uncomfortably warm, despite the 
closeness of the cave's entrance above you.  There's a 
deep, musky odor in the air, and the giant claw marks 
continue downwards.

A Sloping Tunnel~
   A bright light greets your eyes from the north, in 
direct contrast to the darkness of the tunnel overhead.  
You break  out in a sweat due to the overwhelming warmth 
of the air.  The musky odor has grown quite intense, 
drowning out everything else in the air and making it hard 
to breathe.  Something in your gut begins squirming 
uncomfortably as you wonder what's ahead...

The Lair~
   This place is huge!!!  It should be considering the 
dragon's great bulk.  However, instead of seeing the 
customary carnage and mound of gold that one is accustomed 
to seeing in a dragon lair, this one is decorated subtly 
with tapestries and drapes, and other comforts of human 
life.  There is even a huge-dragon sized bed -- undoubtedly 
conjured to life by its elder dragon owner.
