Wyvern guard commander wyv~
the wyvern guard commander~
A mighty wyvern stands here defending his city.
~
   This huge wyvern holds himself with military precision.  His claws are
extremely sharp as if he has taken the time to file them to fine points.  His
scales are a dull red and flex over the massive muscles underneath his hide.  
His glance scans the room and focuses on you intently.  He crooks one huge talon
as you look at him as if to ask what you want from him, better not waist his
time.

the guardian red dragon~
A gigantic red dragon lies here blocking your way.
~

pass by it.  Smoke and hot air Jet forth from its fanged maw and nostrils, while
sparks of reddish light reflect off its deep red scales and the treasure
imbedded in its belli.  Its eyes are closed and although it is over 100 feet
long if it is sleeping..  You might be able to get passed it.  What a guardian!

   This is a truly majestic example of the wyvern race.  She stands with neck
raised to a height of ten feet and her dull blue scales reflect the light giving

the air.

watching over this room.  The wyverns have chosen her as their deity of charity
and the poor because of her kindness and exceptional beauty.  They believe that
all who are in need can call upon her and if their need is strong enough she
will come to aid them in their time of trouble.

   This statue has been carved from pure topaz.  The bright yellow sculpture
looks to be worth a small fortune.  The wyverns worship Gnoff as their god of
social activities and interaction.  They believe he watches all marriages and
gives his blessing to those which will endure.

The Edge of the Desert.~
   In front of you there is a huge sand storm raging.  The wind gusts behind
and to either side, blowing the dust into a blinding cloud.  The howling of the
gusts and your own foot steps are all you can hear.  To your left a steep
outcropping of rock blocks your way.

The blasted sands.~
   You can see the cause of the sand storm now.  A large tornado seems to be
spinning in place.  Where you are standing the grains of sand and rock blast
your skin and the heat of the sun is almost unbearable.  You wonder how big
that storm out there really is?  Behind you the dust still rises in blinding
clouds.  To your right you find a large smooth face of sand polished stone
obstructing your path.

Small piles of sand cover the floor from the storm outside.  Bits of light
reflect off the walls from small crystals imbedded in the rock wall.  The wind
moans through the cavern, echoing down the tunnel that opens to the north.  
While the Storm rages Outside to the South.

North and South.  A low groaning sound echos through the rocky caverns here,
and somewhere far above you can hear the flap of leathery wings.  The rock of
the walls is dull and unremarkable.

The large reptilian citizens of this city move by you paying no attention to
the insignificant creature in their domain.  The stone of this place is the
same dull gray as the outer tunnels.  What a drab place to live.

a building is to the North, While the wall of the cavern stretches above your
range of sight to the South.  To the East it looks as if there are some large
gates set into the stone wall there.  Some very large and well armored wyverns
stand in front of the gates: guards?  The citizens keep their heads down as
they walk through this part of the city, as if not wanting to be recognized.

Intersection of Scale and Fang.~
   You are standing before a huge set of bronze gates.  To the North Fang
street runs the length of the city, while Scale way goes back to the West.  
Two huge wyverns stand in front of the gates to the East.  One of them raises a
giant claw and motions you to move on.  You realize that all the citizens of
the city have disappeared leaving you alone before these massive creatures.

Scale way.~
   This is a long stretch of Scale way.  To the North there is the blank wall
of one of the long low structures that seem to pass as buildings here.  To the
South the smooth wall of the cavern forms a natural boundary to the city.  The
road runs East and West to intersections.  As you are looking around one of the
city guards plods by and gives you a glare from deep-set red eyes.  You begin
to wonder if you should be here at all.

Intersection of Scale and Spike.~
   This part of the city seems a little more busy than the rest.  City guards
are coming and going from a natural cave to the West.  You have to press back
into the wall to the South not to be trampled.  Spike Road runs to the north,
And Scale way extends to the East.  This entire city is very quiet as if the
wyverns are communicating through some other means than speech.

city guards.  To the East is the door to one of the city's many low buildings.
A sign with a picture of a black staff covered in flames hangs over the door.
The citizens seem to shy away from the door as if in fear.  Now what could make
these huge beings afraid?

when it sees you looking at it.  There seems to be a store of some sort to the

buildings to the north are the last line of shops in the main cavern.  You
begin to wonder how these creatures were able to build such a large city when
there seems to be no craftsman among them.

storefront with the picture of a dragon's claw dripping gold and jewels from
it.  To the East there is a sign with a dragon breathing flames and dripping
blood.  Citizens walk in out of both stores still saying nothing to you or

the pitted gray paving stones paying no attention to the pitiful creature that
has invaded their privacy.  Looking South you can see some sort of statue in a
small plaza.  Dragon drive extends East and West, while Claw road goes further
South toward the entrance to the cavern.

why there are so few reflective surfaces in this wealthy metropolis?  To the
north West a large tunnel opens up easily accommodating several 15 foot long
citizens abreast.  East and West Dragon drive runs the width of the main city

attacks as quickly as possible.  Despite the best efforts of the trainees the
gray stone floor is splattered with blood from accidental cuts and gashes.

family history of the royal line of this city.  Large wyverns stand everywhere
looking at you with distaste, "What are you doing here?  " One of them asks.  
The roof is polished gray rock set with crystals and precious stones.  To the
West the gates look like a good way to get out of here, something you are
continually thinking about now.

looking at you with distaste, "What are you doing here?  " One of them asks.  
The roof is polished gray rock set with crystals and precious stones.  To the
North a natural opening in the rock leads to a second chamber.  All you can see
within are the backs of worshiping Wyverns.

The High Cavern of Wyverns.~
   This chamber is draped in the trappings of the royal house of Wyverns.  A
huge throne stands in one corner on a platform made of polished silver.  
Wyverns kneel all around the chamber bowing their necks toward the throne.  
The room is lit by a huge glowing gem set in the roof.  You wonder what kind of
wealth it would take to create such a chamber.

Guards' Cave.~
   You are in the midst of hustling and bustling wyverns.  City Guards line the
walls marking maps of the city with small red pins.  Clerks and citizens
waiting their turn to register complaints stand in the center of this natural
cavern.  There is a large arch to the North, which wyverns enter and leave one
at a time.  To the East a second smaller arch leads back on to Scale way.

Wyvern Watch Central.~
   You are standing at the entrance to the head guard's chamber.  A large red
couch sits against the North wall and tapestries of legendary wyverns cover the
walls.  The room is lit only by a single candle over the couch.  The light
flickers making it look as if the pictures on the wall are coming to life.  To
the south an arch leads back into the waiting area.

A wyvern cave.~
   You are standing in one of the residential caves carved into the walls of
the main cavern.  The sides of the structure are lined with long low couches
for the wyverns to rest on.  Set in one wall there is an altar to the household
gods with a candle burning on it.  There is a cooking hearth in the center of
the room with a smoke hole at the peek of the domed roof to clear the air.  
There are no decorations or other pieces of furniture.  These wyverns don't
seem to need very much to live comfortably.

Wyvern Donations.~
   This is the donation room of the city.  Here charitable souls may drop items
for those less fortunate than themselves.  The walls of this room are covered
with hooks and shelving for more valuable items while barrels and baskets
litter the floor for more common gifts.
