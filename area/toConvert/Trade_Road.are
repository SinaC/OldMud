madman man mad~
the Madman~
A madman has tea with his mortally challenged friends.
~
   He looks up at you with misted eyes and clenches his knife convusively.  
Spluttering and shaking, he begins to rise to his feet, cradling the cold steel
of his knife in his hands.  A tiny voice in your head says very clearly,
'Uh-oh.  ' You feel chilled...  Distant.

The Jeweller smiles at you briefly and motions you in.
~
   You can't guess what age she is; she's one of those few women that seem to
be almost timeless in their looks.  Her eyes glint with laughter as she notices
your scrutiny and slowly examines you.  You squirm under her penetrating gaze.

Butcher~
the Butcher~
The butcher glances at you briefly and SLAMS down his cleaver.
~
   His apron is covered with bloodstains, as are his large, thick python-arms.
He holds a cleaver loosely and easily, almost as if he were born gripping that
thing.  His hair seems greasy and useless on his balding pate.  He sneers at
you and motions for you to take a number.

   Trade Road by Builder_5
Copyright 1993 by Curious Areas Workshop
*
The 'Trade Road' area was built as a first effort for C.A.W., and was kept 
relatively simple. 'Trade Road' is a small neighborhood addition for any 
standard Diku town.  It has one eastern entrance, and one western exit, and 
one southern river-dock area.
'Trade Road' is small; only 52 rooms, 21 mobs, 22 objects, and 5
shops.  It consists mainly of one main road (Trade Road) with various
cross avenues and parallel streets.  Many houses/shops/ buildings have
been detailed, and plenty of room has been left for customizations and
additions.
*
This area was built to conform to the standard Diku gamma 0.0
release.  Along with all other changes you must make to change
this area to your particular db flavor,
*
edit the following rooms:
#00 -- add entrance/exit and change description to fit the outside area.
#17 -- same.
*
The east exit is at #00, the west #17.  
Docks lead away on the river to the south in room #34.
Interesting areas without purpose (yet) are the:
Library (#40)
Brewery (#39)
Trading Post (#53)
Fairgrounds (not open, just south of #15 and #16).
Strange ship (not open, on docks #34).
*(IMPORTANT!)* Mob # #11 should be changed to match the standard
cityguard in the town you are attaching Trade Road to.
The descriptions for rooms #00 and #17 can be switched at will.  The
default is set up to link onto a main city through an east exit to the

west end of Trade Road.  Switching these two descriptions (don't
forget to switch the Edesc's and change east for west and vice versa
in the two descriptions!!!) 'reverses' the area, allowing a west exit
to east Trade Road.
*
Credits
A Big Thanks to Builder_5 for supporting C.A.W. Also, kudos to Tarkin 
of VieMud (viemud.org 4000) for allowing us to use his mud for 
pre-release testing. This area was built with the aid of George 
Essl's Dikued program.  We would like to thank Mr. Essl for his time
and determination to create and support Dikued.
The following people have aided C.A.W. and Builder_5 in numerous ways,
and all receive our deepest gratitude: Shane Finkel Josh 'Champion of 
Bagels' Megerman John D. Horner and the System Adminstrators of ODU

Clay Street~
   Clay Street heads north here, and intersects Trade Road to the south.  The
buildings in this area of town look fairly delapidated; this is not where
'urban renewal' happens evidently.  Westwards, a single intact stone gargoyle
marks the rubble of an ancient church.  A sad feeling akin to gloom presses
down upon your shoulders, making your own load feel that much more heavier to
bear here.

   A small straw pallet lies in the middle of this alleyway, with a few bits of

the south end of Clay Street to the east, and leads deeper in between the
buildings to the west.  A strong smell makes your eyes water; there is graffiti
on the walls, drawn with an unsteady hand and a large supply of fecal material.
A more sinister smell teases you just below the stench here just before a
breeze from the east blows it away from you.

becomes clear that this merchant's method of sale consists of having the
customer describe what they want, whereupon the merchant brings something
similar from the back through a large metal door.  This strikes you as a fairly

of the church.  A few old apple cores and a broken wooden truck tell tales of
this area being a playground for children now, but the ancient, broken
stonework around stand testament to a better age.  For a moment, your
imagination calls images forth of a dynamic pulpit and a full set of pews
around you...  Images quickly shattered by the rustle of your clothing in the

Leatherworker's Shop~
   The smell of old tannin wafts through the air in this shop.  A large
countertop runs along the length of three of the interior walls, with many
strips and bits of leather are lying on it in various stages of completion.  
Many finished products are hanging on the walls, awaiting a buyer.

Ceran's Contracting~
   This shop consists simply of a large wooden desk with a few chairs sitting
in front of it.  Along the walls are renderings of many of XXXX's buildings,
and in the corner is an easel with sketchings of what looks to be a large trade
center.  The air seems cooler in here than anywhere else, and you feel a faint
draft from the ceiling.

Boarding House~
   This room serves as the main entrance and lobby for this run-down boarding
house.  The wooden walls are stained with rot and gods know what else.  The
floors are even worse.  A rickety old desk stands near the interior door, with
a torn and ripped ledger book on it.  The air seems humid with sweat and
desperation, making you feel distinctly uncomfortable.

Hallway~
   This hallway runs the length of the building, with several small rooms
splitting off from it at regular intervals.  One ajar door lends you a glimpse
into the tiny, tiny rooms; room enough for one bed, one chest of drawers, and
one person to stand.  There seems to be plenty of room for dirt and grunge,
however.  Looking around, you see no reason to enter the tiny rooms.  The lobby
to the south is the only exit of interest.

   This shop is decorated with ropes and nets along the walls.  On second

many other various useful sailing equipment.  The shopkeeper's desk is a simple
plank of wood laid across two small anchors...  This place has a definite

probably be your best bet.  There's nothing here anymore, nothing at all.

   Bolts of cloth and barrels of spices stand in monstrous heaps, arranged in a

from the back room, grabs a box of something unidentifiable, and leaves just as
quickly.  A schedule on the wall keeps track of the caravans and ships passing
through the city -- very important information for a merchant.
