The hill near the Black Forest~
   You stand on a hill overlooking a dense forest of old oak trees. A slight
chilling breeze blows by and you can't help but shudder as you look toward it
In the middle of the forest, popping out over the trees is the tall spire of
the Citadel. The symbol of the triangled wheel on the tower's side is there
for all to see. A trail leads eastward down the hill towards the woods.

The outskirts of the Black Forest~
   Little light penetrates the dense foliage of the forest.  Almost no plant
life occupies the hard, rocky ground.  If you push much further into the doomed
forest, you will be in all but total darkness.  Every so often a haunting,
diabolical laugh drifts to your ears.  It drives shivers down your spine.  You
can make out a trail to the south and east.  To the north there is a cabin.  
Or you could flee the woods.

   You are in a cabin in the woods.  Time has not been kind to this structure.
The logs that make up it are starting to rot, and there are a few gaps in the
walls.  Still, it does provide shelter from the wind.  The floor is a rough,
clumpy packed earth.  Whoever lived here has long since abandoned it.  But if
you take a closer look, you may find something useful.

trees, refusing to die.  You feel a bead of sweat form on the back of your

evils of the woods.

The Dark Heart of the woods~
   In the heart of the woods, things are strangely calm.  But it is the calm
before the storm.  In the soft earth you can clearly see hoofmarks of some
horse.  Around the hoofmarks the earth is scorched as if by a hot flame.  
Looking around there are the signs of a strugle.  Somebody placed his bets
against whatever made the hoofmarks, and lost.

Nearing a clearing~
   The trees thin out a bit as you can see a glade.  There is an unnerving
quiet around the area.  You look at the clearing you are standing near and you
recognize it for what it is.  A killing field.  Your boot crunches on the
headless skeleton of some small woodland creature.

The Glade~
   You stand in a glade.  The grass comes up to your knee, although it has been
trampled down in many places where some unfortunate creature was hounded by
something truly evil.  A fresh burst of icy wind whips through the grass
sending waves rolling through the glade.  Out of the chilled wind comes a bout
of the evil, maniacle, unholy cackles that cause your hair to stand on end.

the Stream~
   You walk alongside a small stream.  It silently sweeps away the dead leaves
and other debris as it continues on.  It is a pity that it won't likewise sweep
away your nervousness and trepidation too.  From here you can push on eastward
or you can flee west to the safety of the bridge.  Your other option is to
follow the river to its end.

In the shadow of the citadel~
   You turn up your collar to the subthermal gales.  That's when you see it.  
From here you can see, not 200 yards ahead, the infernal structure that is the
citadel.  You whisper a silent prayer of thanks that there are still many trees
to hide behind.  It is best if the residents of the place don't know of your
existance as long as possible.  It takes a major force of effort to tear your
eyes off the citadel, but you manage.  To the west lies a small stream.  To the
north is a clearing, and south of you is a trail that leads to a small keep in
ruins.

Trapped like a rat!~
   You have walked along the wall and now are in a small walled alcove.  The
crack of evil laughter makes you jump in fright.  It came from right behind
you!  You look around to see a headless rider on a ferocious charger that
breaths fire.  In one hand he holds the reigns to his nightmare in the other he
wields a black scimitar.  In a panic, you look around, but to your horror, you
realize you are boxed in.  The horseman rides closer, he swings his huge
scimitar, trying to lope off your head.  You manage to keep the blow from
decapitating you, but he does connect with your head, sending you sprawling.  
The horseman rides off cackling.

   You have stumbled onto a trail that the forest has yet to reclaim.  If you
strain your eyesight you can barely makeout the remains of a ruined keep.  The
few remaining walls, once a gleeming white are now a dull grey.  Evidently this
keep was laid waste by the forces of the citadel.  Pity.

scattered bits of shattered walls remain as testiment to what once was, now
they are merely waiting for the forest to reclaim them.  At least the ruins
provide some measure of shelter from the incessent, madening wind.

The Ruined Chapel~
   Once upon a time this was this keep's place of worship, but apparently the
beings that this place was consecrated to didn't chose to spare this place any
more than the rest of the castle.  Didn't chose to or weren't able to.  Maybe
when Ilian's black citadel was erected, those protecting beings withdrew their
protection to flee to safety, or maybe they made their stand with the occupants
of the castle, and shared their fate.

   Although the stables are in ruins, they still stand as a building, or at
least half of a building.  The western half is nothing more than a rotting pile
of debris.  The eastern half is beinh precariously held up by rotting wooden
beams.  It does not look all that stable (No pun intended), but still there is
fresh hay on the floor.  Although you take note that some of it has been
scorched by fire of some sort.  There is still water in the trough.  All this
leads you to believe that someone or something still makes use of this place

   This used to be the great hall of the castle, now it is in no better
condition than the rest of the place.  The once highly polished marble floors
are now cracked and covered with rubble that once was the roof.  The west wall
is nothing but a memory and a heap of crumbling stones.  The great stained
glass window set into the north wall, once the pride of the castle has been
shattered into a million shards of rainbow hued glass strewn over the ground.
The east wall still seems soundly built, but you have trepidations about the
south wall It seems like it could come crashing down at any moment.

have fallen like the rest of the keep.  The Gigantic bell that once rang its
clarion call of alarum now is a shattered heap of twisted bronze that sits
amidst the rest of the rubble.

The Room of 10,000 pillars~
   Standing before you are rows upon rows of evenly spaced marble columns.  
Arranged in a perfect square matrix, the two foot thick pillars stretch upward,
reaching higher and higher until they dissappear, enveloped in the darkness
high above where your light dares not reach.

The Observing Chamber~
   This is the observation chamber on the top of the observing tower.  A large
telescope if mounted into the wall allowing a view to the outside.  The center
of the room has a sturdy oaken table which is has a modest collection of maps
and charts.  A spiral starcase leads down the tower.

In the Halls of the Citadel~
   The long vaulted hall extends in an east-west direction.  It serves to
connect the Eastern complex and the Western one.  Your footsteps echo off the
walls, reverbing, rebounding, resounding, refusing to die, as if they knew that
to perish here is to risk eternal damnation.  Above you, supernatural flames
forever dance in crystal orbs that hang suspended from the ceiling by wrougt
iron chains.  The strange light these provide casts long shadows that envelop
long tracts of hall.

The Clock Tower~
   You have entered the clock tower.  As you gaze upward you see a mass of
intricate gears, cogs, and other clockwork parts meshing and grinding above
you.  The effect is almost hypnotic.  A staircase is built into the wall
allowing access to the intricate mechanisms above, if you dare to climb it.

   You stand in the lower portion of the inner working of the citadel's clock
tower.  Gears mesh and springs flex all around you.  You realize that with so
much ambient motion it would be easy to ambush you here.  There is a staircase
down to the ground floor, to go upward any more you will have to climb the
gears.

Amongst the cogs.~
   You are playing a game of High Stakes Hop-Scotch, leaping from gear to gear,
Hanging on a chain one moment, climing on a gear the next.  You had better act
quickly to make your next move before your luck runs out.  One false step here
could be disasterous.  Its a long way down, if you are lucky, if not you stand
to be a red stain between two gears.

Between the Gears~
   You hop to one a stationary gear to catch your breath.  The effect of all
the movement in the background is dizzying.  You momentairly loose track of
your sense of balence.  A slip up that would prove to be fatal.  Without
warning the gear shudders to life and you fall.  You land between the teeth of
a moving cog and come to your senses just as it starts to move.  You barely
escape a crunching death.

   You stand on the central peg of the clock face that the hands rotate around.
An icy wind whips by that threatens to chill you to the soul.  You look around
and can look out over the tops of the oaken trees which extend to the horizon.
On the other side of the citadel you can see the observation tower extending
only slightly higher they you are now.  And then you see the spire of the
citadel which extends high into the sky, casting its long shadow across the
Black Forest.

The Tower Dungeon~
   You have decended into the dank dungeon below the spire.  A strange green
moss grown on the rough hewn rock walls that illuminates the room with an eeire
green glow.  There are a few holding cells that line the far walls A row of
manacles are affixed to the near wall to hold prisoners while they await
torture.  The middle of the room is taken up by several implements of pain.  
There is a vat for boiling oil.  Several racks and countless hideous bladed
instruments, old, diseased, and rusty with age.

   Partway up the tower is the chapel dedicated to the mistress of the tower
and of the Void.  The room is in a circular shape with an altar of some strange
black material in the middle.  Unholy lights burn with the power of the
symmetry, casting an unnatrual sheen on the room.  The spiral staircase that
wraps around the room continues both up and down

The Great Spiral Staircase~
   Just above the altar, the tower hollows itself out and you now stand in a
giant chamber.  In the middle of the hollowed column stands a pair of spiral
staircases twisting and turning upon each other in a doulbe helix.  There is no
central pillar on which the staircases are supported.  You have to marvel at
the wonder of engineering this is.  But only the bravest souls will climb it
because each step you take brings you that much closer to...  Her.

The Great Spiral Staircase~
   You are about halfway up the Great Spiral Staircase.  The steps continue to
spiral onward like two intertwined slinkies made of a dark marble.  Your light
grows noteably dimmer, as if the tower's very darkness consumes the light as
soon as it is produced.  Your legs plead with you to decend the steps, rather
than ascend.  For to go down is to go away from the terror at the top.

The Music Room~
   This is a sprawling room is filled with musical instruments.  The largest
feature of the room is the pipe organ.  It dominates over half of the room.  
The organ has five sets of organ keys which have been polished to a high
reflective sheen.  The brass pipes of the organ are likewise polished waiting
to be used.  In the background you can hear the echos of a phantasmal orquestra
playing in some forgotten and lost dimention, whose music somehow leaks through
to where you now stand.

candles that are lining both sides of the starecase.  The air is thick with the

dotted with pillars supporting the final stories above you.  With nothing to
stop it, the wind is a constant gale through this wind tunnel.  Looking out the
grey skies loom ominously fortelling of a coming storm.  You can step out on to
the balcony if you like, or you can climb the staircase in the middle to
challenge the mistress of this fortress.

   You are on the high balcony on the spire.  It rests right above the huge
symbol of on the walls of the tower you say when you were first entering the
woods.  Glancing around you see the clock tower and the observing post far
below you.  From here you can see the entire expanse of the black woods.  From
the western hills where you began this nightmare to the sea which lies FAR to
the south.  The balcony extends to the south a bit, but be careful There is no
guardrail, and that first step is a doozy.

room seems impossibly large, and the center of it is dominated by a presence
which radiates pure, unadulterated unmitigated, unqualified, unholy evil.  The
mistress of the citadel, Ilian sits on her throne surrounded by a small horde
of her children, She looks at you as her mastery of the dark symmetry probes
your mind to find out if you are signifigant enough to be bothered with
