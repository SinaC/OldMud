   The scenic beauty of McGintey's majestic size and majesty dominates the
northern view as it looms ever closer.  Perched high upon the rock which it is
named for, the city boasts what is most probably the most impressive look for a
city in Dibrova.

the commercial sea crafts of the travel agencies in McGintey, is a serene,
comfortable area where travelers stroll along nonchalantly, boarding their craft
leisurely as most of them are on vacation.

Dock Area~
   The sounds of midshipsmen calling out departure times and the tromp of feet
on the docks to either side assail the senses.  McGintey's commercial travel
docks lie to the east and west.

Dock Area~
   The greasy smell of water tainted by city folk and their dumping of garbage
is the smell that fills the air.  The water here has a slight sheen to it,
almost an oily tint that is layer on top of the water itself.

Dock 5~
   This dock is the last, or first - depending on the way one is traveling, in a
row of docks devoted solely to the moving of commercial travel ships in and out
of the Bay.  The wood of the dock is painted with fresh bright paint, the men
and women who work along it all dressed in finery and ready to tend to any
customer's whim.

Dock 6~
   These are the private docks of the wealthy citizens of McGintey.  Space on
these docks can be rented for a nominal fee in order that a resident of McGintey
might keep their craft close by and in good order.  Indeed, many of the owners
of the craft docked here live aboard them as well.
