Calm Waters~
   The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a feeling
of peace and comfort.  They are not the dead calm that always is associated with
dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll that promises a good day at
sea.

Connector Zones: Beach and Lighthouse, McGintey Bay
This is a fairly large sea made strictly for the purpose of connecting
new continents and islands to the MUD. The mobs have little eq as most
of them are fish or other sea-faring animals. This zone can add a
great deal of openings for builders to add to the overall theme of the
MUD.

Calm Waters~
   The calm sooth mind and body, lending a feeling of peace and comfort to any
traveler who passes.  The waves roll gently by, the ocean seeming harmless and
worry-free.  A sandy beach lies just to the north, running along the length of a
steep cliff face.

Calm Waters~
   The water is a gently rolling calm here that seems to go on forever.  The sky
and the water match almost exactly, so blue the water and so clear the sky.  A
steep cliff face rises up to the north, opening up east of here into a bay.

A Choppy Section of the Sea~
   The water has grown tumultous and rough here, the waves not high but
frequent.  Water splashes into the air as the small waves spalsh into each
other.  McGintey Bay's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this
angle the city itself can be seen.

A Choppy Section of the Sea~

the water bobbing and jumping rapidly.  Every now and again a small fish can be
seen jumping up from the wake, searching for food on the surface.  McGintey
Bay's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this angle the city
itself can be seen.

   The sea has turned to calm that is almost unsettling.  Any sailor would bow

of some sort.  Looking in all directions, the sea is still and quiet.  McGintey
Bay's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this angle the city
itself can be seen.

never once having the desire or need to get up and work.

Upon the Mighty Sea~
   All around is the wide open expanse of the sea, its mighty presence so
strong, so overwhelming as to be staggering.  From horizon to horizon, only blue
sky and a deeper blue can be seen.

Calm Waters~
   The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a feeling
of peace and comfort.  They are not the dead calm that always is associated with
dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll that promises a good day at
sea.  McGintey Bay's entryway lies just north from here, in fact from this angle
the city itself can be seen.

Among Fifteen Foot Waves~
   Waves crush down in giant walls in every direction, the winds howls
unceasingly as the rain is driven harder and harder against the sea's surface.

A Drizzling Rain~
   The rain falls in a steady drizzle that soaks to the bone, but does not cause
any harm.  The wind has all but died out, making the rain all the final and
somber.

A Gentle Breeze~
   The fresh breeze that blows past is a calm, gentle one that can only be
called dreamy.  A sailor in these winds would gladly lie on the deck of his ship
with his tankard of grog beside and happily think of the whores he has known,
never once having the desire or need to get up and work.

Upon the Mighty Sea~
   All around is the wide open expanse of the sea, its mighty presence so
strong, so overwhelming as to be staggering.  From horizon to horizon, only blue
sky and a deeper blue can be seen.

Calm Waters~
   The waters of the sea are very still here, so still that they bring a feeling
of peace and comfort.  They are not the dead calm that always is associated with
dread in a sailor's heart but a slowly moving roll that promises a good day at
sea.

A Choppy Section of the Sea~
   The wind has picked up a bit and has caused the sea to begin to churn a bit,
the water bobbing and jumping rapidly.  Every now and again a small fish can be
seen jumping up from the wake, searching for food on the surface.

of some sort.  Looking in all directions, the sea is still and quiet.
