the wandering spirit~
A strange amorphous being wanders these halls eternally cleaning.
~
   This spirit, having lived out its days in the mortal world, now works off its
final sins by doing menial labour in this realm's purgatory.  In this case,
those chores seem to be cleaning up after the immortals of the land.

Welcors ~~~ ~~~ furnace~
   You seem to be standing in a cave of some sort.  A rather large cave.  
Actually the cave is so large you think you could just as well be standing
outside.  The ceiling is so high above you, you can't really make out the
contours of it.  The sides of the cave are burning.  Had you not felt so
comfortable, you could easily think you were inside a gigantic fire, looking
out through the flames.  You realise, with a sudden stab of fear, that you've
unwittingly stumbled into the home of Welcor, God of Fiery Justice.  You've
better not be here when he gets back...

@rA spot of darkness@n~
   @DBleak darkness engulfs the room, progressively merging the marble floor
into the black horizon.  A low constant humm roars across the air followed by
the sound of raindrops hitting the floor and the puddles that have formed.  
The grey clouds in the sky can be hardly seen except for a small patch right
above, which quickly turns black and merges into the horizon.  In what seems to
be the middle of this eternal empty realm, a pillar of light falls gently on a
small black pillow which seems to be dry and generally unaffected by the rain.

Nivan's Bedchamber~
   The billowing, sheer curtains on the wall of this elegant room are
strawberry red.  The carpet is also red, but instead of the strawberry color of
the curtains they are the dark red of freshly spilled blood.  The wallpaper is
so dark of a red it mocks the color of the carpet, being almost black.  
Sconces holding low-burning candles are spaced at regular intervals along it.
The room smells sweet.  The main feature of the room is the canopy bed directly
in the center.  The hangings from the posts are of the same material as the
curtains, and all of the sheets, blankets, and pillows are different shades of
red.  Its mahogony is carved masterfully, showing naked sprites playing all
along the borders of the very large bed.  It doesn't look like the sort of bed
for sleeping in.

   The bed is masterfully carved, and if you look closely you might see the
mark of the best carver in Haven, the carver of the gate.  Naked sprites play
in somehow erotic poses on a background of woodland, lakes, and streams.  The
satin pillows are plump and look comfortable, and it looks as though you could
sink forever in the very soft bed.  It looks comfortable...  But it doesn't
look like it is used for much sleeping.

   You have entered a room which seems to be made from some sort of glass.  No
matter which direction you look out of, you can see immortals creating new
lands.  On occasion, you can see a mortal entering the realm, trying to make
their mark is this world.  Now you can see how the gods know what is going on.
The room itself is very well decorated.  There is a large fluffy Futon in one
corner.  It looks like the most comfortable thing you have ever seen.  You
notice a BLACK BOOK on a nearby table.  This seems to catch your attention and
your curiosity perks up.

Rumble's Room~
   War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.  The decayed and
degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is
worth war is much worse.  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to
fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a
miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by
the exertions of better men than himself.

old glory flag~
   I fly atop the world's tallest buildings.  I stand watch in America's Halls
of Justice.  I fly majestically over great institutions of learning.  I stand
guard with the greatest military power in the world.  Look up and see me!  I
stand for peace, honor, truth, and justice.  I stand for freedom.  I am
confident, I am arrogant, I am proud.  When I am flown with my banners, my head
is a little higher, my colors a little truer, I bow to no one!  I am recognized
all over the world.  I am worshipped, I am loved, and I am feared!  I have
fought in every battle of every war for more than 200 years: Gettysburg,
Shiloh, Appomattox, San Juan Hill, the trenches of France, the Argonne Forest,
Anzio, Rome, the beaches of Normandy, Guam, Okinawa, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, the
Persian Gulf, and a score of places long forgotten by all, but those who were
there with me...  I was there!  I led my Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and
Marines.  I followed them and watched over them.  They loved me.  I was on a
small hill in Iwo Jima.  I was dirty, battle-worn, and tired.  But my Soldiers
cheered me!  And I was proud!  I have been soiled, burned, torn, and trampled
on the streets of countries that I have helped set free.  It does not hurt, for
I am invincible.  I have also been soiled, burned, torn, and trampled on the
streets of my own country and, when it is by those whom I have served with in
battle-it hurts.  But I shall overcome, for I am strong!  I have slipped the
bonds of Earth and, from my vantage point on the Moon, I stand watch over the
uncharted new frontiers of Space.  I have been a silent witness to all of
America's finest hours.  But my finest hour comes when I am torn in strips to
be used as bandages for my wounded comrades on the field of battle-when I fly
at half-mast to honor my Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines, and-when I lie
in the trembling arms of a grieving mother, at the gravesite of her fallen son
or daughter-I am proud.  My name is Old Glory-long may I wave.  Dear God, long
may I wave.

worth war is much worse.  The person who has nothing for which he is willing to
fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a
miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by
the exertions of better men than himself.

John Stuart Mill

There is one timeless way of building.
  
It is thousands of years old, and the same today as it has always been.
  
   The great traditional buildings of the past, the villages and tents and
temples in which man feels at home, have always been made by people who were
very close to the center of this way.  It is not possible to make great
buildings, or great towns, beautiful places, places where you feel yourself,
places where you feel alive, except by following this way.  And, as you will
see, this way will lead anyone who looks for it to buildings which are
themselves as ancient in their form, as the trees and hills, and as our faces
are.    
                                        --The Timeless Way of Building

july4~
   On July 4, 1776, we claimed our independence from England and Democracy was
born.  Every day thousands leave their homeland to come to the "land of the
free and the home of the brave" so they can begin their American Dream.  The
United States is truly a diverse nation made up of dynamic people.  Each year
on July 4, Americans celebrate that freedom and indepen-dence with barbecues,
picnics, and family ga-therings.  Through the Internet we are learning about
and communicat-ing with people of different nations, with different languages
and different races throughout the world.  Bringing the world closer with
understanding and knowledge can only benefit all nations.  We invite all
nations to celebrate with Americans online this Fourth of July.  Happy
Birthday, America!

Pool of Images~
   A broad mosaic walkway wraps around the natural hotsprings in this cavernous
room.  Three large chandeliers are suspended from the domed ceiling and their
sparkling light dances on the surface of the bubbling hotsprings.  As you peer
into the water images begin to form from out of the depths, coalescing into a
vivid scene.  Your heart begins to pound and your breathing becomes deeper as
you watch the images taking shape in the turbulent liquid.  Your mouth becomes
dry as you see yourself in the watery panorama ...  And time stands still for
just one moment ...  As you see your future in the depths ...

Gatia's Underground Study~
   This room appears to be built deep into the rock.  Bookshelves line every
wall and in the far east cormer there is a simple sleeping pallet.  Set into
the wall near the pallet is a glowing ball that is about the size of a marble.
It only glows faintly but there are others positioned around the walls so as to
light the room efficiently.  There is a large writing desk positioned against
the northern wall.  Upon the table there is a quill and large bottle of ink
sitting beside a VERY thick book.  The right hand page has a small window type
picture which is flying around a landscape.

@RElaseth's Oubliette@n~
   @DThis dungeon's name literally means to forget...  And you were put here to
be forgotten.  No pleas for mercy can be heard outside the cold stone walls
that surround you.  There are no exits except from above, and this one is
securely closed with welded iron.  A shaft of light falls from the grill to
pierce the darkness and strike you, your only company in this black abyss.  @n

Inside Santa's Love Sponge~
   All 8 walls of the hexagon room is coloured a different shade of red.  In
one of the corners stands a large rocket shaped lava lamp, bubbling up blue and
yellow blobs.  The ceiling and floor of this room is just one big mirror, make
it possible to see yourself from every angle imaginable.  A shelf housing just
about every contriception that has every been invented gets pushed along as a
fresh batch is placed on every morning/afternoon and night.  Without much
guessing, you can tell Santa is a gift to all women.

The Builders' Board Room~
   The actual Builder's Academy is zone 13 (@RGOTO 1300@n to check it out).
This zone should be able to teach anyone, no matter how new, the basics of 
building. It is a work in progress so please bear with me. Remember, making
God Rooms and Equipment is forbidden.

The Immortals' Mortal Board Room~
   Here the Gods have magically created an exact copy of the mortal board room.
Any God can easily post and read messages from the mortal board room without
being seen by any mortals.  The Immortal Board Hall is to the west.

The Halls Of Justice~
   You are standing in a magnificent marble hall, the only exit is back to the
north.  Statues of Karileena the goddess of Honour and Justice, are lining the
walls.  You realize this is where the exalted gods meet to discuss what course of
action to take against offenders in the realms.

Other Worlds ~
   You are in a lush field, seemingly somewhere in empty space, a small cobble
stone trail through the darkness leads west, back to the Builders Board Hall of
the Builder.  As you look around you see twinkling stars small points of light,
interrupting the darkness of this place.  Cold and dark as it is, you feel at
ease and you are overwhelmend by a sense of calm, and clairity, as if from here
you are able to go anywhere you might want to, even reach out for a star, and
mold it as you please.

Tanto's Sacrificial Grotto~
   Ebony stalagmites resembling vicious fangs hungryly decend from the ceiling
of the cave, a soft crimson glow illuminates the cave as if the walls
themselves were on fire.  The light seems to be more intense toward the back of
the cave where a huge flames spout from an enormous stone altar of polished
black granite.

WALLS~
   Animated shadows, cast by the light of the altar, dance eerily against an
orange backdrop of reflected flames on the ancient walls around you.  The
actual surfaces of the walls have blackened from years of absorbing smoke from
the altar, while a thin, green film oozes slowly down them in a continuous
stream.

ALTAR~
   You observe a flaming, cyclinder-shaped altar sturdily built from large,
crimson-colored bricks and mortar.  It seems to have been dug deep into the
ground like a well.

STALAGMITES, CEILING~
   The ceiling is almost completely covered by jagged stalagmites, formed by
years of calcium deposits and water gradually dripping in from above.  The
stalagmites, and the ceiling itself, are coated in soot and ashes from the fire
raging perpetually in the stone altar.
